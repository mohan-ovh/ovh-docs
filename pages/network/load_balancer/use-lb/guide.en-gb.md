## Instructions

### Managing your Load Balancer via the Control Panel

To manage your Load Balancer via the Control Panel, go to the `Cloud`{.action} section (1), then the `Load Balancer`{.action} (2) section on the left-hand menu. The main page for the service will then appear:

On this page, you will see the following information:

|Element|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Status|An overview of your Load Balancer with the IP, front-ends, functional farms and servers added|
|Use|A summary of how to use your Load Balancer|
|Graphs|In this section, you will see the graphs linked to service, by concurrent connections or requests per minute|
|Information|Your IPv4 address and the Additional IPs linked to them, as well as the number of outgoing IPv4s (see more details by clicking on the ellipses)|
|Configuration|Here, you can customise the name of your solution (which will appear at the top of the left-hand column) The cipher(s) are customisable, as well as the datacentre where your Load Balancer is based|
|Subscription|Here, you will see the admin details for your solution|

To add `Frontends`{.action} or `Server farms`{.action}, simply click on their respective buttons. A form will then help you configure each part of your solution.

### Managing frontends

To add front-ends, simply go to the `Frontends`{.action} section, and click `Add a frontend`{.action}. The following menu will then appear:
