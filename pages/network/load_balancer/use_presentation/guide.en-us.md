## Requirements

- No specific requirements.


## Instructions

This new solution is based on robust open-source solutions: HAProxy for TCP traffic, and Nginx for UDP traffic.

There are no limits to what you can do! The new OVHcloud Load Balancer solution can be used to work with a variety of protocols:

|Type|Description|Advantages|Technology|
|---|---|---|---|
|HTTP|All HTTP/HTTPS web services|Optimised for L7 (application layer) processing|HAProxy|
|TCP|For any network services that aren’t HTTP|Supports all TCP applications|HAProxy|
|UDP|For all UDP traffic types|Supports all UDP applications|Nginx|

With this new solution, you will get:

- OVHcloud anti-DDoS protection
- your services replicated worldwide (Anycast)
- advanced HTTP/HTTPS support (redirections, headers, ACL, etc.)
- a service compatible with an Additional IP
- vRack supported
- redundancy - your Load Balancer functions on separate instances, working individually on isolated, redundant hardware


### Basic parts

- The new OVHcloud Load Balancer solution is made up of three basic parts:

![General](images/diag_gen.png){.thumbnail}

|Basic parts|Function|
|---|---|
|Front-end|The front-end defines the protocol type (HTTP/TCP/UDP) of the OVHcloud Load Balancer service. This part also has the service’s listening port|
|Farm|The farm receives the incoming traffic from the front-end. This part takes care of the load balancing|
|Server|These are the servers that receive the final traffic, and respond via the application|

With these three basic parts that make up the Load Balancer, you can configure it to use nearly all possible load balancing methods.


### Why use the OVHcloud Load Balancer?

#### Balance the load

This is the basic function of a load balancer, but the OVHcloud Load Balancer offers much more.

#### Eliminate downtime

The OVHcloud Load Balancer service can automatically detect when a server is not responding. When this happens, it redirects incoming traffic to another server, if possible. This resolves the problem without affecting your website.

#### Scale your infrastructure easily

You can add or remove farms, front-ends or servers from the OVHcloud Load Balancer solution without interrupting your service.

#### Make maintenance easier

If there is any maintenance scheduled for your solution, you can now easily place a farm in downtime mode to prevent it from receiving traffic. If you need to do this, it’s easy to add your server again once the maintenance has finished.

#### Combine your services

You can now combine various OVHcloud services in the Load Balancer, for example:

- Public Cloud instances with Additional IPs
- VPS with Additional IPs
- Dedicated servers with Additional IPs
- vRacks

#### Anycast

You can balance your load across a variety of geographical zones.

#### Distribute any kind of traffic

The OVHcloud Load Balancer doesn’t just work with HTTP traffic any more! You can now use it with all TCP and UDP traffic types.


#### Email server

Balance the load between your email servers.
