## Objective

The OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes service provides you Kubernetes clusters without the hassle of installing or operating them. This guide will cover the creation of a new cluster.

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section and select the Public Cloud project concerned.

Access the administration UI for your OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes clusters by clicking on `Managed Kubernetes Service`{.action} in the left-hand menu and click on `Create a cluster`{.action}.

Select a location for your new cluster.

Choose the minor version of Kubernetes.

> [!primary]
> We recommend to always use the last stable version. 
> Please read our [End of life / end of support](/pages/platform/kubernetes-k8s/eos-eol-policies) page to understand our version policy.
>

You can now choose to integrate your Kubernetes cluster into a private network using OVHcloud vRack. For more information about this option, please read our guide [Using the vRack](/pages/platform/kubernetes-k8s/using-vrack).

Now you can configure the default node pool. A node pool is a group of nodes sharing the same configuration, allowing you a lot of flexibility in your cluster management. 

> [!primary]
> You can read the [Managing node pools](/pages/platform/kubernetes-k8s/managing-nodes) guide for more information on node pools.

In the next step, define the size of the default node pool.

Alternatively, you can enable the `Autoscaling`{.action} feature for the cluster. Define the minimum and maximum pool size in that case.

In the next step, choose the appropriate billing mode (monthly or hourly). You can also enable the anti-affinity mode here.

> [!primary]
> By enabling anti-affinity, current and future nodes will be launched on different hypervisors (physical servers), guaranteeing higher fault tolerance. Anti-affinity node pools can only include up to 5 nodes.
> 

Finally, enter a for name your cluster and click the `Send`{.action} button.

The cluster creation is now in progress. It should be available within a few minutes in your OVHcloud Control Panel.
