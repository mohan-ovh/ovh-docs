## Objective

OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes service provides you Kubernetes clusters without the hassle of installing or operating them. This guide will explain how to deploy a simple *Hello World* application on a OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements

- an OVHcloud Managed Kubernetes cluster
- at least one node on the cluster (see the [ordering a node](/pages/platform/kubernetes-k8s/managing-nodes) guide for details) 
- a well configured  `kubectl` (see the [configuring kubectl](/pages/platform/kubernetes-k8s/configuring-kubectl-on-an-ovh-managed-kubernetes-cluster) guide for details) 

> [!warning]
> When a __LoadBalancer__ Service resource is created inside a Managed Kubernetes cluster, an associated Public Cloud Load Balancer is automatically created, allowing public access to your K8S application.
> The Public Cloud Load Balancer service is hourly charged and will appear in your Public Cloud project. For more information, please refer to the following documentation: [Network Load Balancer price](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/prices/#network)

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Deploy your first application

The following command will deploy a simple application (nginx image) using a [Kubernetes Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) and a [Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

Create a `hello.yml` file for our `ovhplatform/hello` Docker image:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  labels:
    app: hello-world
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
    name: http
  selector:
    app: hello-world
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: hello-world-deployment
  labels:
    app: hello-world
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: hello-world
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: hello-world
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello-world
        image: ovhplatform/hello
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

And apply the file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f hello.yml -n default
```

After applying the YAML file, a new `hello-world` service and the corresponding `hello-world-deployment` deployment are created in the `default` namespace:

<pre class="console"><code>$ kubectl apply -f hello.yml -n default
service/hello-world created
deployment.apps/hello-world-deployment created
</code></pre>

> [!primary]
> The application you have just deployed is a simple Nginx server with a single static *Hello World* page. 
> Basically it just deploys the Docker image [`ovhplatform/hello`](https://hub.docker.com/r/ovhplatform/hello/){.external}

### Step 2 - List the pods

You have just deployed a `hello-world` service in a pod in your worker node. Let's verify that everything is correct by listing the pods.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n default -l app=hello-world
```

You should see your newly created pod:

<pre class="console"><code>$ kubectl get pods -n default -l app=hello-world
NAME                                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-deployment-d98c6464b-7jqvg         1/1       Running   0          47s
</code></pre>

> [!primary]
> `default` namespace is the Kubernetes namespace by default so you don't need to specify it in your kubectl commands.

### Step 3 - List the deployments

You can also verify the deployment is active:

```bash
kubectl get deploy -n default -l app=hello-world
```

And you will see the `hello-service-deployment`:

<pre class="console"><code>$ kubectl get deploy -n default -l app=hello-world
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hello-world-deployment        1         1         1            1           1m
</code></pre>

### Step 4 - List the services

And now you're going to use `kubectl` to see your service:

```bash
kubectl get services -n default -l app=hello-world
```

You should see your newly created service:

<pre class="console"><code>$ kubectl get services -n default -l app=hello-world
NAME          TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
hello-world   LoadBalancer   10.3.234.211   51.178.69.47   80:31885/TCP   6m54s
</code></pre>

> [!primary]
> If under `EXTERNAL-IP` you get `<pending>`, don't worry, the provisioning of the LoadBalancer can take a minute or two, please try again in a few moments.

### Step 5 - Test your service

Retrieve the URL of the `hello-world` application:

<pre class="console"><code>$ export SERVICE_URL=$(kubectl get svc hello-world -n default -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip}')

$ echo "http://$SERVICE_URL/"
http://135.125.83.30/
</code></pre>

Copy/paste the URL in your browser to see your new running `hello-world` application:

![Testing your service](images/deploying_an_application-01.png){.thumbnail}


You can even test the newly created service, in command line, with curl:

```bash
curl $SERVICE_URL
```

You should see your newly created service:

```bash
curl $SERVICE_URL
<!doctype html>

<html>
<head>
<title>OVH K8S</title>
</head>
<style>
.title {
font-size: 3em;
padding: 2em;
text-align: center;
}
</style>
<body>
<div class="title">
<p>Hello from Kubernetes!</p>
<img src="./ovh.svg"/>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

> [!primary]
> If you have an error message "Failed to connect to 135.125.83.30 port 80: Connection refused", it's normal. The service is starting, so you have to wait a few seconds in order to test it again.

### Step 6 - Clean up

At the end you can proceed to clean up by deleting the service and the deployment.

Let's begin by deleting the service:

```bash
kubectl delete service hello-world -n default
```

If you list the services you will see that `hello-world` doesn't exist anymore:

<pre class="console"><code>$ kubectl delete service hello-world -n default
service "hello-world" deleted

$ kubectl get services -l app=hello-world -n default
No resources found in default namespace.
</code></pre>

Then, you can delete the deployment:

```bash
kubectl delete deploy hello-world-deployment -n default
```

And now if you list you deployment you will find no resources:

<pre class="console"><code>$ kubectl delete deploy  hello-world-deployment -n default
deployment.apps "hello-world-deployment" deleted

$ kubectl get deployments -n default -l app=hello-world
No resources found in default namespace.
</code></pre>

If now you list the pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n default -l app=hello-world
```

you will see that the pod created for `hello-world` has been deleted too:

<pre class="console"><code>$ kubectl get pods -n default -l app=hello-world
No resources found in default namespace.
</code></pre>
