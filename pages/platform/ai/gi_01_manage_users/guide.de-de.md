## Objective

The **users** of the AI Training platform are simply your Public Cloud users that you can create in the OVHcloud Control Panel. To give access to **AI Training** to any of your users, you need to grant them the **AI Training Operator** role. Then you can use this user's credentials to authenticate.

**AI Training** includes the OVHcloud Object Storage as a persistent storage solution for your [data](https://docs.ovh.com/de/publiccloud/ai/data). To use these features the user needs to be granted the **Objectstore Operator** role since it implies read/write access to the Object Storage.

## Requirements

- A **Public cloud** project
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.de/&ovhSubsidiary=de)

## Instructions

### Creating AI Training users

To use **AI Training** with the `ovhai` CLI or to access jobs urls you need to create users with the correct roles.

Users management is available in the `Public Cloud` Control Panel under `Project Management` > `Users & Roles`

Create a new user and specify the required roles. Two roles are used within **AI Training**:

- AI Training Operator: Grants access to **AI Training**
- Objectstore Operator: Grants read/write access to the OVHcloud Object Storage.

It is recommended to assign both roles.
