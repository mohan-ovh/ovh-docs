## Objective

This page provides the technical descriptions of the automated backup methods and routines for each engine.

We continuously improve our offers. You can follow and submit ideas to add to our roadmap at <https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/projects/2>.

## Backup Methods

* Daily remote site backup:

We back up our managed public cloud databases every 1 (incremental snapshots), 12 or 24 hours (backups) — depending on the product — with the ability to restore from the latest point in time, based on the retention period of the chosen customer plan.

* PITR:

Either you run into a problem or you just want to see what your data looked like at a prior date, you can restore your data to any point in time within the retention period of the chosen customer plan.
