## Objective

This guide lists all the supported advanced parameters that allow you to configure your Public Cloud Databases for OpenSearch according to your use cases.

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account   
- A database running on your OVHcloud Public Cloud Databases ([this guide](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/publiccloud/databases/getting-started/) can help you to meet this requirement)   
- Access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB) or to the [OVHcloud API](https://api.ovh.com/console/)   


## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> The management of advanced parameters is not supported via Terraform.

### Using the OVHcloud Control Panel

Please refer to this [guide](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/publiccloud/databases/advanced-configuration/#using-the-ovhcloud-control-panel) to find out how to change your advanced parameters from the OVHcloud Control Panel.

### Using API

Please refer to this [guide](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/publiccloud/databases/advanced-configuration/#using-api) to find out how to change your advanced parameters from the OVHcloud API.


### Advanced parameters for OpenSearch

Below you can find a summary of every configuration option available for OpenSearch service:

| Parameter | Value Type | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| `opensearch.action_auto_create_index_enabled` | boolean | Explicitly allow or block automatic creation of indices. Defaults to true |
| `opensearch.cluster_max_shards_per_node` | long | Controls the number of shards allowed in the cluster per data node |
| `opensearch.cluster_routing_allocation_node_concurrent_recoveries` | long | How many concurrent incoming/outgoing shard recoveries (normally replicas) are allowed to happen on a node. Defaults to 2. |
| `opensearch.http_max_content_length` | long | Maximum content length for HTTP requests to the OpenSearch HTTP API, in bytes. |
| `opensearch.http_max_header_size` | long | The max size of allowed headers, in bytes |
| `opensearch.http_max_initial_line_length` | long | The max length of an HTTP URL, in bytes |
| `opensearch.indices_memory_index_buffer_size` | long | Percentage value. Default is 10%. Total amount of heap used for indexing buffer, before writing segments to disk. This is an expert setting. Too low value will slow down indexing; too high value will increase indexing performance but causes performance issues for query performance. |
| `opensearch.indices_queries_cache_size` | long | Percentage value. Default is 10%. Maximum amount of heap used for query cache. This is an expert setting. Too low value will decrease query performance and increase performance for other operations; too high value will cause issues with other OpenSearch functionalities. |
| `opensearch.indices_query_bool_max_clause_count` | long | Maximum number of clauses Lucene BooleanQuery can have. The default value (1024) is relatively high, and increasing it may cause performance issues. Investigate other approaches first before increasing this value. |
| `opensearch.indices_recovery_max_bytes_per_sec` | long | Limits total inbound and outbound recovery traffic for each node. Applies to both peer recoveries as well as snapshot recoveries (i.e., restores from a snapshot). Defaults to 40mb |
| `opensearch.indices_recovery_max_concurrent_file_chunks` | long | Number of file chunks sent in parallel for each recovery. Defaults to 2. |
| `opensearch.override_main_response_version` | boolean | Compatibility mode sets OpenSearch to report its version as 7.10 so clients continue to work. Default is false |
| `opensearch.script_max_compilations_rate` | string | Script compilation circuit breaker limits the number of inline script compilations within a period of time. Default is use-context |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_analyze_queue_size` | long | Size for the thread pool queue. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_analyze_size` | long | Size for the thread pool. Do note this may have maximum value depending on CPU count - value is automatically lowered if set to higher than maximum value. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_force_merge_size` | long | Size for the thread pool. Do note this may have maximum value depending on CPU count - value is automatically lowered if set to higher than maximum value. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_get_queue_size` | long | Size for the thread pool queue. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_get_size` | long | Size for the thread pool. Do note this may have maximum value depending on CPU count - value is automatically lowered if set to higher than maximum value. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_search_queue_size` | long | Size for the thread pool queue. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_search_size` | long | Size for the thread pool. Do note this may have maximum value depending on CPU count - value is automatically lowered if set to higher than maximum value. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_search_throttled_queue_size` | long | Size for the thread pool queue. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_search_throttled_size` | long | Size for the thread pool. Do note this may have maximum value depending on CPU count - value is automatically lowered if set to higher than maximum value. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_write_queue_size` | long | Size for the thread pool queue. |
| `opensearch.thread_pool_write_size` | long | Size for the thread pool. Do note this may have maximum value depending on CPU count - value is automatically lowered if set to higher than maximum value. |
