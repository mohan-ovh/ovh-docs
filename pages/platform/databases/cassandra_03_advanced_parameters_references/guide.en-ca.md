## Objective

This guide lists all the supported advanced parameters that allow you to configure your Public Cloud Databases for Cassandra according to your use cases.

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account   
- A database running on your OVHcloud Public Cloud Databases ([this guide](https://docs.ovh.com/ca/en/publiccloud/databases/getting-started/) can help you to meet this requirement)   
- Access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca) or to the [OVHcloud API](https://api.ovh.com/console/)   


## Instructions

### Advanced parameters for Cassandra

Below you can find a summary of every configuration option available for Cassandra service:

| Parameter | Value Type | Description |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| `cassandra.batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb` | long | Fail any multiple-partition batch exceeding this value. 50kb (10x warn threshold) by default. |
| `cassandra.batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb` | long | Log a warning message on any multiple-partition batch size exceeding this value. 5kb per batch by default. Caution should be taken on increasing the size of this threshold as it can lead to node instability. |
