## Objective

Public Cloud Databases allow you to focus on building and deploying cloud applications while OVHcloud takes care of the database infrastructure and maintenance in operational conditions.

**This guide explains how to connect to a MySQL database instance with MySQL Workbench.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.pt/&ovhSubsidiary=pt)
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/pt/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- A MySQL database running on your OVHcloud Public Cloud Databases ([this guide](https://docs.ovh.com/pt/publiccloud/databases/getting-started/) can help you to meet this requirement)
- [Configure your MySQL instance](https://docs.ovh.com/pt/publiccloud/databases/mysql/configure-mysql-instance/) to accept incoming connections
- A MySQL Workbench stable version installed and public network connectivity (Internet). *This guide was made with MySQL Workbench version 8.0.28*.

## Concept

A MySQL instance can be managed through multiple ways.
One of the easiest, yet powerful, is to use a Command Line Interface (CLI), as shown in our guide: [Connect to MySQL with CLI](https://docs.ovh.com/pt/publiccloud/databases/mysql/connect-cli/) or by using programming languages, such as [PHP](https://docs.ovh.com/pt/publiccloud/databases/mysql/connect-php/) or [Python](https://docs.ovh.com/pt/publiccloud/databases/mysql/connect-python/).

Another way is to interact directly using a management tool like MySQL Workbench.

## Instructions

### Installation

MySQL Workbench can be downloaded for free at the following link: <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/>.

Once you have downloaded and installed it, follow the steps below to set up a remote connection to your MySQL instance.
