## Objective

Public Cloud Databases allow you to focus on building and deploying cloud applications while OVHcloud takes care of the database infrastructure and maintenance in operational conditions.

**This guide explains how to connect to a MySQL database instance with MySQL Workbench.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg);
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account;
- An up and running Public Cloud Database for MySQL.
- A MySQL Workbench stable version installed and public network connectivity (Internet). This guide was made with MySQL Workbench version 8.0.28.

## Concept

A MySQL instance can be managed through multiple ways.
One of the easiest, yet powerful, is to use a Command Line Interface (CLI), as shown in our guide : [Connect to MySQL with CLI](https://docs.ovh.com/sg/en/publiccloud/databases/mysql/connect-cli/) or by using programming languages, such as [PHP](https://docs.ovh.com/sg/en/publiccloud/databases/mysql/connect-php/) or [Python](https://docs.ovh.com/sg/en/publiccloud/databases/mysql/connect-python/).

Another way is to interact directly using a management tool like MySQL Workbench

In order to do so, we will need to install MySQL Workbench, then configure our Public Cloud Databases for MySQL instances to accept incoming connections, and finally configure MySQL Workbench.

## Instructions

### Installation

MySQL Workbench can be downloaded for free at the following link: <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/>

Once you have downloaded and installed it, follow the steps below to set up a remote connection to your MySQL instance.

### Configure your MySQL instance to accept incoming connections

Before making a connection, we need to verify that our MySQL instance is correctly configured.

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg) and switch to `Public Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar. After selecting your Public Cloud project, click on `Databases`{.action} in the left-hand navigation bar, and select your MySQL instance.

#### Step 1: Verify your user roles and password

Select the `Users`{.action} tab. Verify that you have a user with sufficient rights and a configured password. If you don't remember the user's password, you can either create a new user or regenerate the password of an existing user. Be careful! By doing so you will need to update all the places where you already use this user + password pair.

This first user **avnadmin** comes with the following grants:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, RELOAD, PROCESS, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER, SHOW DATABASES, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, LOCK TABLES, EXECUTE, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE VIEW, SHOW VIEW, CREATE ROUTINE, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE USER, EVENT, TRIGGER ON *.* TO "avnadmin"@"%" WITH GRANT OPTION

GRANT REPLICATION_APPLIER,ROLE_ADMIN ON *.* TO "avnadmin"@"%" WITH GRANT OPTION
```

#### Step 2: Authorize incoming connections from the MySQL client

In this step, select the `Authorised IP's`{.action} tab (Access Control List).
By default, a Public Cloud Database does not accept any form of connection from the outside world.
This way we can help prevent intrusive connection attempts.

Click to authorize a new IP, and enter the IP of your MySQL Workbench environment. In our case we will enter 109.190.200.59.

> If you want to allow connections from the outside, you can enter the IP 0.0.0.0/0. Please use it carefully.

### Connect with MySQL Workbench

#### Collect required informations

Select the `General information`{.action} tab to find the required login information.

Select the `Databases`{.action} tab to get the database name.

#### Configuration

Click `New Connection`{.action}

Store password for connection in keychain
