## Objective

Creating a project is the first step in deploying [Public Cloud instances](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/public-cloud/).

**This guide will take you through the steps of creating your first Public Cloud project.**

## Requirements

- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au)

## Instructions

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au), go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section and click on `Create your first OVH Public Cloud project`{.action}.

You can now add a voucher if you have one. Only a voucher provided for your OVHcloud branch can be used.

> [!warning]
> If you had previously created a Public Cloud project in your account and deleted it, you do not qualify to use the voucher.
>

Give your project a name, read and accept the contracts, and then click on the `Continue`{.action} button.
