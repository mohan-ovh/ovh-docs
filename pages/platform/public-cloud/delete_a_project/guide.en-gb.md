## Objective

When you no longer need your [Public Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/){.external} project, you can delete it directly from the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}.

When you delete your Public Cloud project, a final invoice will be created for the remainder of what you owe.

> [!warning]
>
Please note that deleting a project is not the same thing as deactivating your Public Cloud instances. When you delete a project, the resources contained in it will be destroyed. This action can not be undone.
