## Objective

With the OVHcloud Public Cloud you can now change the contacts for billing and project administration. 
This means that you can seperate the OVHcloud account which manages your bills from the OVHcloud account which manages your various instances. 

This guide explains how to edit your contacts.


## Requirements

- Two OVHcloud accounts
- A Public Cloud project
- Be sure that both admin and billing contacts belongs to the same subsidiary

## Instructions

In order to modify your project contacts, first go to the `Contacts and Rights`{.action} below Project management tab.

Once you have confirmed the new contacts, both OVHcloud accounts will receive an email containing a code allowing them to confirm this change:

You have to confirm this procedure in both accounts.

## Confirmation

To do this go to your account properties and select `My contacts`{.action} on the right:

![change-contacts](images/controlpanel.png){.thumbnail}

In both contacts Control Panel, you have to go to the `My requests`{.action} section:

![change-contacts](images/controlpanel1.png){.thumbnail}

Click the `...`{.action} on the right and click `Accept`{.action}. A new window will appear: 

![change-contacts](images/contactchange3.png){.thumbnail}

You just have to insert the code which you have just received by email into the window which appeared after you confirmed the procedure from both accounts.

After this is done, contacts have been changed as requested.
