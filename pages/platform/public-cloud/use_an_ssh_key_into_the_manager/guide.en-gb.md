## Objective

SSH is a protocol making it possible to access and communicate with a server in an authenticated and encrypted manner.

**Find out how to use SSH keys with the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

## Requirements

- a [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVH account
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager)
- an [SSH key](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/public-cloud/create-ssh-keys/)


## Instructions

> [!primary]
>
If you would like to store an SSH key in the OVHcloud Control Panel, we recommend to use RSA or ECDSA encryption. ED25519 is currently not supported.

There are two ways to add an SSH key from the Public Cloud interface:

- The first and more direct method is done at the time of the creation of an instance.
- The second method is to add a key from the SSH key manager.


### Creation of an instance
From the Public Cloud client interface, to create a cloud instance, click on `Create an instance`{.action} in the Instances menu under the `Compute`{.action} section on the left-hand menu.

Then, during the creation of the instance, and on step 3, you will be asked for your SSH key.

If you already have keys, simply select the key of your choice.

If you want to add a key, click on `Add a key`{.action}. Create a name for your key in the "SSH Key name" box and paste the key into the box labeled "SSH key". Click `Add a key`{.action} to finish.

### From the key management tool

Once the "SSH keys" has been selected from the left menu of your project, the "SSH keys" tab will be available.

Click on `Add a key`{.action} then click on `Add this key`{.action} after you have named the key and pasted the key in the box.

This key will be available to use at the next [creation of a Public Cloud instance](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/public-cloud/get-started-with-a-public-cloud-instance/){.ref}.
