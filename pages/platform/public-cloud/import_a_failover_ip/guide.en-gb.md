## Objective

If you need to configure a failover IP address on your instances because

- you have multiple websites on your instance 
- you host international projects
- you want to migrate from a Dedicated Server to a Public Cloud instance

... you can import a failover IP address that is linked to a different OVHcloud service.

**This guide explains how to import this failover IP into your OVHcloud Public Cloud project.**

## Requirements

- a [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager)
- a [failover IP address](https://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/ip_failover.xml)


## Instructions

First, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager), go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section and select the Public Cloud service concerned. Then, select `Failover IP`{.action} in the "Network" section.
