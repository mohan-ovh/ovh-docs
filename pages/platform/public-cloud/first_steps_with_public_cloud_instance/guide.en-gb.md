**Last updated 4th December 2019**

## Objective

You can manage your Public Cloud projects easily via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager). You will find all of your infrastructure (instances, backups, disks, SSH keys, etc.) and storage projects there (including the list of your containers).

**This guide explains the first steps with a Public Cloud Instance.**

## Requirements

- a [Public Cloud Instance](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/public-cloud) in your OVHcloud account
- an [SSH key](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/public-cloud/create-ssh-keys/)


## Instructions

### Access the management interface for the instance

First, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager), go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section and select the Public Cloud service concerned. Then, click in the `Instances`{.action} tab on your left.

On that page you will see a summary of all your Instances. There will be several pieces of information displayed here:

- the model of your instance
- its name and region
- hard disks
- your instance’s IP address
- its state

### Edit the configuration of an instance

In the management interface for the instance, click on the 3 dots on the right of the instance, and select `Edit`{.action}.

In the window that opens, you can:

- rename the instance
- change the instance model 
- reinstall the instance on another operating system (**please note that if you choose to do this, the data currently stored on the instance will be deleted**)
- switch from hourly billing to a fixed monthly rate (bills will then be sent on a pro rata basis, based on the day of the month that you switch)

### Create a backup of an instance

You can create a backup of an instance from its admin page.  To do this, click on the 3 dots on the right of the instance and select `Create a backup`{.action}. Then you will see this page with all the necessary information: ![public-cloud](images/backup.png){.thumbnail} .

Then the following information is being displayed: ![public-cloud](images/backup1.png){.thumbnail} .

After you have confirmed the following information will be displayed: ![public-cloud](images/backup2.png){.thumbnail} .

Once backup has been done will be able to see it in `Instance Backup`{.action} section: ![public-cloud](images/backup3.png){.thumbnail} .

You can refer to our guide to [Backing up an Instance](../back-up-instance/) if you need help with this. 

### Create an automatic backup of an instance

You can schedule an automatic backup of an instance from its admin page. To do this, click on the 3 dots on the right of it and select `Create an automatic backup`{.action}: ![public-cloud](images/backupauto.png){.thumbnail}

Then the following page will be displayed: ![public-cloud](images/backupauto1.png){.thumbnail} .

Once you have selected the necessary information and you have clicked on `Create`{.action}, you will be redirected to the following page: ![public-cloud](images/backupauto2.png){.thumbnail} .

At any time you can go to that `Workflow management`{.action} to delete the current automatic backup process: ![public-cloud](images/backupautodelete.png){.thumbnail}

You can refer to our guide to [Backing up an Instance](../back-up-instance/) if you need help with this. 

### Retrieve your login information

In the management interface for the Instance, click on `Instance details`, and check the information bellow `Login information`{.action}. There, you can retrieve the SSH commands you need to use to connect to your instance.

### Access the VNC console

Using the VNC console, you can access your instance directly. Please note, however, that you will need to have configured a password for the root user.

To access this console, click on `VNC console`{.action} in the "Instances" dashboard.

### Reboot an instance

There are two different ways of rebooting an instance:

- Hot reboot (software)
- Cold reboot (hardware)

In the management interface for the instance, click on the 3 dots you find on the right of the instance, and select either `Hot reboot (software)`{.action} or `Cold reboot (hardware)`{.action}.

Then confirm your request in the window that opens.

### Reinstall an instance

You can reinstall an instance and keep the same operating system. **Please note that if you choose to reinstall, all of the data currently stored on your instance will be erased.**

In the management interface for the Instance, click on the 3 dots you find on the right of the instance, and select `Reinstall`{.action}. Then click `Confirm`{.action} to start the process.

In the management interface for the instance, click on the down-arrow icon, and select `Delete`{.action}. Then click confirm to start the process.
