## Objective

As part of the Microsoft audit, conducted by the consulting firm Ernst & Young, OVHcloud sent you a letter to request you to declare your uses.

By subscribing to the Public Cloud offer, you have obtained the right to use third-party software and you have agreed to use this software in accordance with their conditions of use. The owners of third-party software, such as Microsoft, have the right to check the compliance of your use of their software. 

To do so, you can choose from the 3 following options:

* Option 1: [Run the script provided by Ernst & Young yourself](./#option-1-run-the-script-provided-by-ernst-young-yourself)
* Option 2: [Give OVHcloud access to your servers for running the script provided by Ernst & Young](./#option-2-give-ovhcloud-access-to-your-servers-for-running-the-script-provided-by-ernst-young)
* Option 3: [Run it and send the screenshots and any other details necessary to OVHcloud](./#option-3-run-it-and-send-the-screenshots-and-any-other-details-necessary-to-ovhcloud)

**Step 9**: Zip and name the folder "EY_Output" as follows: EY_Output_ipv4 address of your Public Cloud instance, followed by .zip (for example: EY_Output_10.10.10.10.zip).

**Step 12**: Send us this encrypted file as well as the following terms available at [this address](https://github.com/ovh/docs/tree/develop/pages/platform/public-cloud/Microsoft-audit/files) (must be completed and signed by you), before 26 May, 2020, using the following address: auditmicrosoft@ovhcloud.com

### Option 3: Run it and send the screenshots and any other details necessary to OVHcloud

If you cannot apply one of the two procedures mentioned previously, please apply the following procedure.

OVHcloud support will ask you to send them details of your "hardware" and "software" information securely. In addition to these details, you will also need to explain the reasons that prevent you from following the first two options.

**Step 1**: Run the "systeminfo" command from the command line. You can access the command line by typing "cmd" in the Windows run dialogue. After running the command, please scroll down to the top of the command prompt window - there is no need to include the patch details in the screenshot.

**Step 2**: Open the "Add/Remove Programs" or "Programs and Features" dialogue from the control panel and place it side by side with the command line (as shown in the first screenshot below).
    
> [!primary]
> 
> Please be aware that if there are too many programs to show them in a single screenshot, you will need to take several screenshots. For second and subsequent screenshots, please ensure that the last program in the previous screenshot is the first program in the following screenshot. (see images below).
> 

Check that all of the following elements are visible in all screenshots: 

* Server name (host name)
* Date of initial installation
* Processor(s)
* Application installation date

#### SQL version and edition

**Step 3**: If Microsoft SQL Server is deployed on the device, take a screenshot showing the SQL version and edition.

The easiest method to get this proof is to log in to the SQL server using the SQL Server Management Studio and bring up the server properties panel (see image below) by right-clicking on the name of the SQL server in the object explorer panel.

![option3-1](images/option3-3.png)

**Step 4**: Send this information by email to the following address: auditmicrosoft@ovhcloud.com, before 26 May, 2020.

This proof will then be sent to Ernst & Young for compliance analysis.
