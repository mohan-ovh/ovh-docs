## Objective

Our new Load Balancer as a Service (LBaaS) solution is based on [OpenStack Octavia](https://docs.openstack.org/octavia/queens/reference/introduction.html){.external} and is fully integrated into the Public Cloud universe.

**Learn how to configure an OVHcloud Load Balancer with the help of this guide.**

## Requirements

- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/it/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account
- Using the [OpenStack command line environment](/pages/platform/public-cloud/prepare_the_environment_for_using_the_openstack_api)
- The [OpenStack Command Line Interface](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/user-guide/common/cli-install-openstack-command-line-clients.html){.external} tool installed on your working environment

## Instructions

### Configuring your private network

Before creating a Load Balancer, you will need to set up a private network:

```bash
openstack network create my_network

openstack subnet create my_subnet --subnet-range <my_private_ip_range/mask> --network my_network --no-dhcp

openstack router create my_router

openstack router add subnet my_router my_subnet

openstack router set --external-gateway Ext-Net my_router
```

You can now attach your instances to the new network. We recommend following our guide to [integrate an instance into vRack](/pages/platform/network-services/getting-started-07-creating-vrack#instance-integration). List the addresses of your instances in your network with the following command:

```bash
openstack server list
```

In the next step, configure the network interfaces of your instances according to this output.

### Creating the Load Balancer

You can view a list of the different Load Balancer flavors we offer with this command:

```bash
openstack loadbalancer flavor list
```

You can now create your Load Balancer with the following command. In this example, we will create a "Small" Load Balancer.

```bash
openstack loadbalancer create --name my_load_balancer --flavor small --vip-subnet-id my_subnet
```

Your Load Balancer will be configured with an IP address of the private network. If you want to have access from the internet, you will need to attach a Floating IP address.

### Attaching a Floating IP address to a Load Balancer

This is how to attach a Floating IP address to a Load Balancer:

```bash
openstack floating ip create Ext-Net
openstack floating ip set --port <my_load_balancer_vip_port_id> <floating_ip>
```

> [!primary]
>
> To retrieve the VIP port ID of your Load Balancer, use `openstack loadbalancer show my_load_balancer`.


### Configuring your Load Balancer

In this example we will configure an HTTP Load Balancer. In order to listen on port 80 of the Load Balancer, create a Listener with this command:

```bash
openstack loadbalancer listener create --name my_listener_http --protocol HTTP --protocol-port 80 my_loadbalancer
```

Once the Listener has been created, you need to add each instance that can respond to external requests. To do this, you must create an Instance Pool:

```bash
openstack loadbalancer pool create --name my_pool_http --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --listener my_listener --protocol HTTP
```

Add your instances to the Instance Pool:

```bash
openstack loadbalancer member create --subnet-id my_subnet --address <private_ip_instance_1> --protocol-port 80 my_pool
openstack loadbalancer member create --subnet-id my_subnet --address <private_ip_instance_2> --protocol-port 80 my_pool
```

You can now access your Load Balancer via the Floating IP or private IP address from an instance in your private network.
