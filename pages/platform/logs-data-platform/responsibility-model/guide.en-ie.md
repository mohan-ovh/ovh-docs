**Last updated January 26th, 2023**

The Logs Data Platform is an interface for collecting, indexing and analyzing logs. Wherever your logs come from, you can use the platform to choose different entry points depending on the protocol, security level and format. You can analyze and use data with a variety of different APIs and web interfaces.

The RACI below details shared responsibilities between OVHcloud and the customer for Logs Data Platform services.
This shared model can help relieve the customer’s operational burden.

## RACI definition
