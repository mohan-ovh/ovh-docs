## Definition

**Namespaces** in a **ML Serving project** are organization entities for your models. It allows user to simply classify their models depending on their needs by attaching them to an existing namespace.

Each namespace is linked to an **object storage container** of the same **public cloud** project where users can upload their serialized machine learning models. That **object storage container** is configurable.

Each namespace is also linked to a [docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/). The default [docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) is an OVHcloud provided one but this can be configured.

## Considerations

-   Number of created namespaces is restricted to `100 maximum` per **public cloud** user.
-   Each namespace is linked to one and only **object storage container** of the same **public cloud** project.
-   Each namespace is linked to one and only **docker registry**.
-   Each namespace can contain as many models as the user wants.
-   Each model deployed inside a namespace will be reachable from the same base url such as `https://<id-of-namespace>.<cx>.gra.serving.ai.ovh.net` where `<id-of-namespace>` will be a generated unique identifier of the **namespace** and `<cx>` the identifier of your assigned cluster.

## Under the hood

**Namespaces** in a **ML Serving** project correspond to [namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) in a [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

## Going further

-   You can check the [OVHcloud documention on how to create a namespace](../initialize-namespace).
