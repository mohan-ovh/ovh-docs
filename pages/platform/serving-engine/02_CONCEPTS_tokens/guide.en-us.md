## Definition

**Tokens** in a **ML Serving project** refer to encoded [JWT tokens](https://jwt.io/) containing access rights information for querying or managing models in a namespace.

**Tokens** object contains 2 attributes :

-   The list of authorized roles
-   The target resource

### Roles

There are 2 available roles :

-   `model-management` : Tokens containing this role are allowed to manage models (deploy, update, delete) targeted by the applying resource.
-   `model-evaluation` : Tokens containing this role are allowed to evaluate models (i.e call the model http endpoint) targeted by the authorized resource.

### Applying resource

The resource attribute describes the resource (i.e. model identifiers) on which **roles** are applied (see the example below). You can provide an exact identifier that will match the resource id or a fuzzy string that ends with * to match multiple resources starting with the same prefix or a * to match all resources

#### Example

A token containing a role of `model-evaluation` with an applying resource of `iris*` will be allowed to request evaluation of each model whose identifier starts with `iris` inside its namespace.

## Considerations

-   Each Token is created inside a [namespace](../namespaces) and is only relevant for that [namespace](../namespaces).
-   Tokens have no expiration date but can be renewed. For security purpose it is important for users to understand that tokens should be regularly renewed to avoid compromised ones.

## Going further

-   You can check the [OVHcloud documention on how to manage models](../manage-tokens).
