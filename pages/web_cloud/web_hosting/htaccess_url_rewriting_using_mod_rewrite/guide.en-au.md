## Objective

**mod_rewrite** is one of the modules available on the HTTP **Apache** web server. **Apache** is installed on our entire shared hosting infrastructure. With this web server, you can manage all HTTP requests sent to your Web Hosting plan.

For example, Apache retrieves HTTP requests generated by your website’s visitors’ internet browsers, and returns the content requested by those same requests. Internet browsers then display the content of your website to your visitor.

For example, the **mod_rewrite** allows you to rewrite and redirect:

- A visitor who enters your URL in “HTTP” to your website’s URL in “HTTPS”.
- All of the URLs used for your website to a specific folder or file.
- A visitor who enters your URL without “www” directly to the URL of your website with “www”.

The **mod_rewrite** module offers an infinite number of possibilities. Below are some of the most common use cases.

## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/)
  
## Instructions

> The following examples should be set up in a ".htaccess" file. Please note that the rules you define in this file have a direct impact on your website. Always verify the rules you add before applying them to your website.
>

The ".htaccess" file in which you are going to configure the Apache **mod_rewrite** can be placed in several different folders. Be sure to follow the rule of **only one** ".htaccess" file per folder or subfolder.

The parameters defined in a ".htaccess" file apply to the directory in which it is present, as well as to all its subdirectories.

To edit (or create) directories, log in to your hosting plan’s FTP space. If you need help with this, please refer to our guide on [Accessing your Web Hosting plan’s storage space](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/ftp_connection).

Below are some of the most common examples of using Apache **mod_rewrite**. Some of them can also help the SEO your website.

### Redirect all HTTP requests to a single file in your site

Edit the ".htaccess" file in the root directory that contains your website. Place the following code inside (by replacing the **test.php** in our example with the name of your own file):

```bash
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule .* test.php
```

In our example, all requests made to your website are redirected to the **test.php** file.

### Redirect some of the HTTP requests to a single file in your website

Edit the ".htaccess" file in the root directory that contains your website. Put the following code inside (replacing in our example the values **thetest** and **/test_wslash/test.php** with the names of your own files):

```bash
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule thetest /test_wslash/test.php
```

In our example, all HTTP requests that contain **/thetest** are redirected to the **/test_wslash/test.php** file.

### Redirect your domain name to its "www" subdomain

This rewrite rule forces your website’s address/URL to include its subdomain "www".

Edit the ".htaccess" file in the root directory that contains your website. Put the following code inside (replacing in our example **domain.tld** with your own domain name):

```bash
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain.tld$
RewriteRule ^(.*) http://www.domain.tld/$1 [QSA,L,R=301]
```

This URL rewrite can help SEO your website.

### Redirect requests to a particular folder without displaying the folder

When you use an OVHcloud shared hosting plan, your domain name (for example **domain.tld**) is declared as a `Multisite` to display the content of a target folder also called `root folder`. You can customise the name of this `root folder`.

Please refer to our guide on [Hosting multiple websites on your Web Hosting plan](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/multisites_configure_multisite) if you would like more information on this subject.

Some users do not place their websites directly in the `root folder`, but inside a subfolder (for example: **MyWebsite**) inside this `root folder`.

In this case, the URL to access the site will be as follows: **http://domain.tld/MyWebsite**.

If your website is not located directly in the `root folder` declared for your domain name in `Multisites`, and you do not want to display the folder name in your website’s URL, edit the ".htaccess" file located in the root directory of your website. 

Place the following code inside (replacing the values **domain.tld** with your domain name, and **MyWebsite** with the name of your own folder):

```bash
RewriteEngine on
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^domain.tld
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/MyWebsite
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /MyWebsite/
```

In our example, this forces your website address to be displayed as **http://domain.tld**, whereas in reality the page called is **http://domain.tld/MyWebsite**.

### Automatically redirect a visitor to use HTTPS when the website was accessed using a HTTP URL 

SSL certificates encrypt the data exchanged in HTTP with your website. This prevents people or malicious robots from collecting data exchanged between the site and the visitor, such as bank details.

If you do not have an SSL certificate, please refer to our guide on [Managing an SSL certificate on an OVHcloud shared hosting plan](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/ssl_on_webhosting).

Some of your visitors may forget to enter the URL to access your site by **https://**: This poses a significant risk to the data exchanged between your website and their web browsers.

To prevent this, edit the ".htaccess" file located in the root directory of your website. Put the following code inside (replacing in our example **domain.tld** with your own domain name):

```bash
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.domain.tld/$1 [R,L]
```

In our example, all requests made with a URL in **http://** will be automatically rewritten to **https://**. Visitors will be redirected to your website by clicking on **https://**.
