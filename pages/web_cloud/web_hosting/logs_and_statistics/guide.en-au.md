## Objective

Web server logs and website statistics are included in your Web Hosting plan, easily accessible from your OVHcloud Control Panel.

**This guide provides an overview of the available logs and statistics.**

## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au)

## Instructions

Log in to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au) and select `Web Cloud`{.action} in the top navigation bar. In the left-hand menu, click `Hosting plans`{.action}.

Select the hosting plan concerned, then click on the `Statistics and logs`{.action} tab.

The screen that opens has 4 sections:

- **Website visit statistics**: Presents many statistics concerning your hosting.
- **Website logs**: Displays raw logs for your hosting.
- **Infrastructure statistics**: Presents graphical statistics (HTTP and SQL requests, FTP commands, etc.).
- **User administration**: Displays users who are authorized to access statistics.

### User administration

Creating a user will allow someone to access your hosting plan’s statistics without having access to your OVHcloud Control Panel. 

Click the `Create a new user`{.action} button in the `User` section and follow the instructions as shown below.

To access your website's statistics with a user you have created, you must enter the following address by replacing `000` with your hosting cluster number and `mydomain.ovh` with your website's domain name (without "www"):

```bash
https://logs.cluster000.hosting.ovh.net/mydomain.ovh/
```

In the `Statistics and logs`{.action} section, click `View statistics`{.action}.<br>
From the tab of your browser that displays the statistics window, retrieve the link that will be used to log in with one of the users you have created.

### Visit statistics

The **OVHcloud Web Statistics** tool helps you to track and control the traffic of websites hosted on your Web Hosting plan, by visually compiling statistics of page visits and audience measurement.

The OVHcloud Web Statistics dashboard presents 7 sections:

- Dashboard: Visualises the website traffic on your Web Hosting plan.
- Browsers: Shows a ranking of the most used internet browsers to view your sites.
- Geolocalization: Groups site visitors according to their location.
- Requests: Displays the ranking of the most visited pages on your sites.
- Robots: Visualises the automated attempts to connect to your sites.
- Status: Displays statistics of the failures and successes encountered, based on the HTTP codes returned.
- FAQ: Opens the section dedicated to frequently asked questions.

The `Period selection` field in the top right-hand corner allows you to select a specific period.

### Logs

You can view the raw logs of your site with a delay of about 5 minutes.

Different types of logs are available:

- **web**: Here you can find the various logs of your site visits, as well as the outgoing actions from your site. For example, this allows you to detect malicious access attempts.
- **ftp**: The different FTP connections will be stored in these logs.
- **error**: These logs contain the errors generated by your site.
- **cgi**: These logs collect the various calls to the cgi.bin scripts that were made.
- **out**: These are the external calls of your hosting.
- **ssh**: These logs indicate the different connections made with the SSH protocol.
- **cron**: The results of executing your [scheduled tasks](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/cron_tasks) are logged here.

### Hosting activity

In this section you can view your Web Hosting plan’s infrastructure activity as well as the resource usage.

Switch to the `General information`{.action} tab, then scroll to the bottom of the page.
