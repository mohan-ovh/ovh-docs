## Requirements

- An [OVHcloud web hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/web-hosting/)  that contains at least one database
- A [domain name](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/domains/).
- [WordPress installed](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/cms_install_1_click_modules) on your web hosting plan

If one is not already installed, [add an SSL certificate](/pages/web_cloud/web_hosting/ssl-activate-https-website#step-1-activate-the-ssl-certificate-on-the-web-hosting-plan) for the domain name associated with your website before you continue.
  
## Instructions
  
**WooCommerce** is an extension for **WordPress** and can be installed like any other plugin.

### Installation

Log in to your admin interface by typing `/wp-admin` or `/wp-login` in your address bar after your domain name URL (redirection is done automatically):

In the left-hand menu, go to `Plugins`{.action} then click on `Add New`{.action}:

![Dashboard, Plugins, Add new](images/wordpress-woocommerce-first-steps_2.png){.thumbnail}

On the new `Add Plugins` page, type "woocommerce" in the search bar in the top right and click `Install Now`{.action} in the **WooCommerce** box:

![Install WooCommerce](images/wordpress-woocommerce-first-steps_3.png){.thumbnail}

Now click on `Activate`{.action}:

![Activate WooCommerce](images/wordpress-woocommerce-first-steps_4.png){.thumbnail}

### Configuration 

#### Method 1: Using the configuration wizard

If you have not yet set up your **WooCommerce** plugin, a setup wizard will help you fill in the information for your online store. Fill in the form and click `Continue`{.action}:

![Setup Wizard - Store Details](images/wordpress-woocommerce-first-steps_5.png){.thumbnail}

Then select your business domain(s):

![Setup Wizard - Industry](images/wordpress-woocommerce-first-steps_6.png){.thumbnail}

Choose the type of products you want to sell on your website (some options are not free):

![Setup Wizard - Product Types](images/wordpress-woocommerce-first-steps_7.png){.thumbnail}

Then enter the nature of your activity:

Add optional (and free) features if you want:

Finally, choose a theme from the list:

![Setup Wizard - Choose a theme](images/wordpress-woocommerce-first-steps_10.png){.thumbnail}

**WooCommerce** then prompts you to create an account to use the **Jetpack** plugin, which is automatically installed in addition to **WooCommerce**. This account creation is optional, you will have access to the limited functions of **Jetpack** without having to authenticate.

Your online store is now configured with the general settings.

#### Method 2: Manual configuration

Click `Plugins`{.action} to list the installed extensions and then click `Installed plugins`. You will see a list of your plugins. Click `Settings`{.action} in the **WooCommerce** module:

You can also access these settings by clicking directly on `WooCommerce`{.action}, then `Settings`{.action}:
