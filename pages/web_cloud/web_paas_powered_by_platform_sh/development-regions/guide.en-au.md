## Objective  

Web PaaS offers a region for hosting project data.


## Public IP addresses

The public IP addresses for regions are stable, but not guaranteed to remain same.
Before any change, you are notified well in advance regarding affected projects.

They're useful for cases such as when you have a corporate firewall that blocks outgoing SSH connections.
In such cases, add the inbound IP addresses for your region to your allow list.

## Regions
