## Objective  

Python is a general purpose scripting language often used in web development.
You can deploy Python apps on Web PaaS using a server or a project such as [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Supported versions

| **Grid** | 
|----------------------------------|  
|  2.7 |  
|  3.5 |  
|  3.6 |  
|  3.7 |  
|  3.8 |  
|  3.9 |  
|  3.10 |  


## Usage example

### Run your own server

You can define any server to handle requests.
Once you have it configured, add the following configuration to get it running on Web PaaS:

1\. Specify one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions):

```yaml   
type: 'python:3.10'
```  

2\. Install the requirements for your app.

```yaml  
location=".platform.app.yaml"
dependencies:
    python3:
        pipenv: "2022.5.2"

hooks:
    build: |
              pipenv install --system --deploy
``` 
3\. Define the command to start your web server:


```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
web:
    # Start your app with the configuration you define
    # You can replace the file location with your location
    commands:
        start: python server.py
```

### Use uWSGI

You can also use [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage your server.
Follow these steps to get your server started.

1\. Specify one of the [supported versions](#supported-versions):



```yaml   
type: 'python:3.10'
```  


2\. Define the conditions for your web server:


```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
web:
    upstream:
        # Send requests to the app server through a unix socket
        # Its location is defined in the SOCKET environment variable
        socket_family: "unix"

    # Start your app with the configuration you define
    # You can replace the file location with your location
    commands:
        start: "uwsgi --ini conf/uwsgi.ini"

    locations:
        # The folder from which to serve static assets
        "/":
            root: "public"
            passthru: true
            expires: 1h
```

3\. Create configuration for uWSGI such as the following:


```ini 
location="config/uwsgi.ini"
[uwsgi]
 # UNIX socket to use to talk with the web server
 # Uses the variable defined in the configuration in step 2
 socket = $(SOCKET)
 protocol = http

 # the entry point to your app
 wsgi-file = app.py
```

   Replace `app.py` with whatever your file is.

4\. Install the requirements for your app.
```yaml  
   dependencies:
    python3:
        pipenv: "2022.5.2"

hooks:
    build: |
              pipenv install --system --deploy
```
5\. Define the entry point in your app:


```python
# You can name the function differently and pass the new name as a flag
# start: "uwsgi --ini conf/uwsgi.ini --callable <NAME>"
def application(env, start_response):

    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/html')])
    return [b"Hello world from Web PaaS"]
```

## Package management

Your app container comes with pip pre-installed.
To add global dependencies (packages available as commands),
add them to the `dependencies` in your [app configuration](/pages/web_cloud/web_paas_powered_by_platform_sh/configuration/configuration-app):

```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
dependencies:
    python3:
        <PACKAGE_NAME>: <PACKAGE_VERSION>
```

```yaml  
dependencies:
    python3:
        pipenv: "2022.5.2"

hooks:
    build: |
              pipenv install --system --deploy
```
## Connect to services

The following examples show how to access various [services](/pages/web_cloud/web_paas_powered_by_platform_sh/configuration/configuration-services) with Python.
For more information on configuring a given service, see the page for that service.

## Configuration reader
While you can read the environment directly from your app, you might want to use the
[`platformshconfig` library](https://github.com/platformsh/config-reader-python). 
It decodes service credentials, the correct port, and other information for you.
