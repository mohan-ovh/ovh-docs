## Objective  

Node.js is a popular asynchronous JavaScript runtime.
Deploy scalable Node.js apps of all sizes on Web PaaS.
You can also develop a microservice architecture mixing JavaScript and other apps with [multi-app projects](/pages/web_cloud/web_paas_powered_by_platform_sh/configuration/configuration-app).

## Supported versions

| **Grid** | 
|----------------------------------|  
|  6 |  
|  8 |  
|  10 |  
|  12 |  
|  14 |  
|  16 |  


To use a specific version in a container with a different language, [use a version manager](/pages/web_cloud/web_paas_powered_by_platform_sh/languages/node_js/languages-nodejs/nvm).

## Deprecated versions

| **Grid** | 
|----------------------------------|  
|  0.12 |  
|  4.7 |  
|  4.8 |  
|  6.1 |  
|  6.9 |  
|  8.2 |  

## Usage example

To use Node.js on Web PaaS and Node.js together, configure the `.platform.app.yaml` file with a few key settings
(a complete example is included at the end).

### 1. Specify the version

Choose a version from the [list above](#supported-versions)
and add it to your [app configuration](/pages/web_cloud/web_paas_powered_by_platform_sh/configuration/configuration-app):


```yaml   
type: 'nodejs:16'
```  


### 2. Specify any global dependencies

Add the following to your app configuration:

```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
dependencies:
    nodejs:
        yarn: "*"
```

These are now available as commands, the same as installing with `npm install -g`.

### 3. Build your app

Include any commands needed to build and setup your app in the `hooks`, as in the following example:

```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
hooks:
    build: |
        npm run setup-assets
        npm run build
```

### 4. Start your app

Specify a command to start serving your app (it must be a process running in the foreground):

```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
web:
    commands:
        start: node index.js
```

### 5. Listen on the right port

Make sure your Node.js application is configured to listen over the port given by the environment.
The following example uses the [`platformsh-config` helper](#configuration-reader):

```js
// Load the http module to create an http server.
const http = require('http');

// Load the Web PaaS configuration
const config = require('platformsh-config').config();

const server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {
    response.writeHead(200, {"Content-Type": "application/json"});
    response.end("Hello world!");
});

// Listen on the port from the Web PaaS configuration
server.listen(config.port);
```

### Complete example

A complete basic app configuration looks like the following:

```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
name: node-app

type: nodejs:16

disk: 512

dependencies:
    nodejs:
        yarn: "*"

hooks:
    build: |
        npm run setup-assets
        npm run build

web:
    commands:
        start: "node index.js"
```

## Dependencies

By default, Web PaaS assumes you're using npm as a package manager.
If you have a `package.json` file in your code, the default [build flavor is run](/pages/web_cloud/web_paas_powered_by_platform_sh/configuration/configuration-app/build#build):

```bash
npm prune --userconfig .npmrc && npm install --userconfig .npmrc
```

This means you can specify configuration in a `.npmrc` file in your app root.

### Use yarn as a package manager

To switch to yarn to manage dependencies, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Switch to a build flavor of `none` (so packages aren't installed with npm)

```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
build:
    flavor: none
```

#### Step 2: Add yarn as a global dependency

```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
dependencies:
    nodejs:
        yarn: "1.22.17"
```

#### Step 3: Install dependencies in the `build` hook


```yaml 
location=".platform.app.yaml"
hooks:
    build: |
        yarn --frozen-lockfile
```

## Connecting to services

The following examples show how to use Node.js to access various [services](/pages/web_cloud/web_paas_powered_by_platform_sh/configuration/configuration-services).
To configure a given service, see the page dedicated to that service.
