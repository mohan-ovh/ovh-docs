## Instructions

### SMS credits

0,5 SMS credit is the cost for sending 1 SMS message in the United Kingdom. The price is degressive depending on the number of SMS credits you buy at once. 

You can view the list of SMS packs [here](https://www.ovh.co.uk/sms/).

**E.g. to purchase a pack of 100 SMS credits, each credit costs 0.03 ex. VAT.**

Sending 1 SMS message in the United Kingdom costs 0,5 credit. With this pack, you can send 200 SMS messages in the United Kingdom.<br>
Sending 1 SMS message in India costs 0.4 credit. With this pack, you can send 250 SMS messages in India.

On [this webpage](https://www.ovh.co.uk/sms/prices/), you can view the price in credits for sending SMS messages, depending on their destination.

### Automatic re-credit

To ensure that you are never short of credit on your account, you can enable automatic re-crediting. Once a minimum threshold of remaining credit has been reached, a new number of credits is automatically added to your SMS account.

> [!warning]
>
> The automatic re-crediting option can only be enabled if the following conditions are met:
>
> - a SEPA direct debit payment method is present and validated in your OVHcloud account.
> - your SMS service must be at least 2 months old.

To enable automatic re-crediting, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB){.external}, then go to the `Telecom`{.action} tab. Next, click on the `SMS`{.action} section in the services bar. Choose the SMS account you would like to enable automatic re-credit for.

Go to the `Options`{.action} menu (1), then `Automatic re-credit`{.action} (2).
