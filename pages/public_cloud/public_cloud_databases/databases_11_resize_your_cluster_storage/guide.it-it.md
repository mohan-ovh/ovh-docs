## How to increase storage

This option is available through the OVHcloud [API](https://api.ovh.com/console/) and the [Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.it/&ovhSubsidiary=it
/).

### Requirements

- Access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.it/&ovhSubsidiary=it
/) or to the [API](https://api.ovh.com/console/)
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/it/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account

## How to decrease storage

This option is currently only available via the OVHcloud [API](https://api.ovh.com/console/).

### Requirements

- Access to the OVHcloud [API](https://api.ovhcloud.com){.external} (create your credentials by consulting [this guide](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps))
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/it/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account

### Instructions

In order to be able to decrease your storage, you must have a threshold of 20% between your current disk space used and the new disk storage (base storage + additional storage).

For instance, if you have a MongoDB with 120 GB of storage and 80 GB of disk space used, you can decrease the storage up to 100GB on that endpoint:

> [!api]
> @api {PUT} /cloud/project/{serviceName}/database/mongodb/{clusterId}
