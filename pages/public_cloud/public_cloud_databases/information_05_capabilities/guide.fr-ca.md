## Public Cloud Databases

With our managed database services, we take care of the database infrastructure and administration, including set-up, backup, scalability and security.
Choose from a large portfolio of popular engines.

We continuously improve our offers. You can follow and submit ideas to add to our roadmap at <https://github.com/ovh/public-cloud-roadmap/projects/2>.

## Database Engines

We currently offer seven database engines:

### MySQL

MySQL is an open-source fully-managed relational database service. It's fast, reliable, scalable, and user-friendly.<br>
See our [MySQL Capabilities and limitations](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mysql_01_capabilities) guide.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is an open-source fully managed and hosted relational database service. It's a high-performance engine that offers flexibility through a variety of included advanced extensions.<br>
See our [PostgreSQL Capabilities and limitations](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/postgresql_01_capabilities) guide.

### MongoDB

MongoDB is a fully managed and scalable document-oriented database management system which does not require a predefined data schema.<br>
See our [MongoDB Capabilities and limitations](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/mongodb_01_concept_capabilities) guide.

### Redis

Redis is an open-source fully managed in-memory NoSQL database. It helps you store and access data quickly and efficiently.<br>
See our [Redis Capabilities and limitations](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/redis_01_capabilities) guide.

### M3db

M3db is a fully managed distributed time series database. It's scalable and offers high-availability, which is ideal for your monitoring environment and time series applications.<br>
See our [M3db Capabilities and limitations](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/m3db_01_capabilities) guide.

### Opensearch

OpenSearch is an open-source fully managed search, analytics and observability engine. It is ideal for logs management and offers search and analytical aggregations.<br>
OpenSearch is an open source fork derived from Elasticsearch.<br>
See our [OpenSearch Capabilities and limitations](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/opensearch_01_capabilities) guide.

### Cassandra

Apache Cassandra is an open-source fully managed NoSQL database. It's highly fault-tolerant with asynchronous replication.<br>
See our [Cassandra Capabilities and limitations](/pages/public_cloud/public_cloud_databases/cassandra_01_capabilities) guide.

## Specific feature Plans

Three plans are available:

### Essential

The Essential plan typically offers the basic features and functionalities required for managing a database.
It is designed for test and development environments or non-critical projects.

### Business

The Business plan is more comprehensive and suitable for organizations with higher database demands.
This is the first production-ready offering.

### Enterprise

The enterprise pricing plan is the most advanced and robust option available for managed databases.
