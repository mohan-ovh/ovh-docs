## Configure data imports and transformations

The Data Processing Engine (DPE) is the component that lets you **create and execute data pipelines outside and within Data Platform**. Everything is automated, from the management and deployment to the scalability, to help you focus on the business logic of your data Project rather than its logistics.

While the Lakehouse Manager is where you plan out your data structure at the **conceptual level**, the Data Processing Engine is where you execute actions to **physically impact your data**.

### Actions

An `action` consists of a unitary physical operation on the data. Actions can be organized in stages in order to produce automated data processing pipelines called `workflows`.

Click on the **Actions** menu of your Data Processing Engine. You should see the two *Load* actions that were automatically generated in the previous step

![DPE Actions](images/actions-step1.png)

These Load actions will physically extract the data from your sources and load it into your data warehouse, following the schema made in the Lakehouse Manager.

#### Create more actions

For this tutorial, you will create an action used to aggregate your data into the *dataset\_history* table you created in the previous part.

Click on **New action** and select the *Aggregate action* template from the Data Platform Store.

![DPE agg action 1](images/actions-step2.png)

There will be 3 simple steps to configure the aggregate action:

1. Select the source table : *stations\_rides*
2. Select the destination table: *dataset\_history*
3. Select the source table : *chicago\_calendar\_full*

Change the join condition to an *INNER join* using the dropdown menu. This will ensure that you do not have any null fields in the records of your dataset\_history table. Also make sure to copy and paste the following sql code to let the aggregate action know how the tables are going to be linked:

```sql
stations_rides.data = chicago_calendar_full.date
```

> [!primary]
>
> Note this is required because the concept of *joining tables using primary keys* does not exist for **standard datasets**. If you are using an **external dataset**, then it will be automatically generated.
>

The attributes need to be manually mapped out. Refer the screenshot below and make sure all the attributes are mapped correcectly. Make sure that the attribute *rides*, which is the metric you are looking to aggregate, and switch it to a **SUM** function. Everywhere else, switch it to the **MAX** function as it is: most DBMS require you to apply an aggregate clause to attributes that aren't part of the *GROUP BY* clause.

> If you are using an **external dataset**, then the attributes will be automatically mapped out. Only the attribute *rides* needs to be switched to **SUM**.

Finally, let's define the categorical attribute *cat\_temperature* that you created earlier. Click on the **< map >** (short for "mapping") option in blue option dropdown as shown below and switch it to **< sql >**.

![DPE agg action 3](images/actions-step5.png)

Simply copy-paste the SQL command below:

```sql
CASE 
WHEN MAX(chicago_calendar_full.temperature)<40 THEN 'very cold'
WHEN MAX(chicago_calendar_full.temperature)<48 THEN 'cold'
WHEN MAX(chicago_calendar_full.temperature)<55 THEN 'medium'
WHEN MAX(chicago_calendar_full.temperature)<62 THEN 'hot'
ELSE 'very hot'
END
```

> [!primary]
>
> I**Leaving a destination attribute unmapped in the Aggregate action configuration will trigger an error when the action is launched**. If you'd rather leave the destination field empty, make sure to simply remove it from the list of mapped attributes.
>

Click on **Create** at the top-right.

Good job 💪! **You've now successfully generated all the actions** required for this tutorial.

> [!primary]

> IOf course, your real-life Project will probably have more than 3 actions. You can organize your actions in folders and rename them if needed. You can also use more than one repository, especially if you are working in collaboration with teammates. Repositories of actions can be versioned and also synced with external Git repositories.

### Workflows

Workflows are like a movie script to put your actions into... action. 🎬

Within a workflow, actions are organized in sequential stages. Within a stage, all actions will be run in parallel while stages will always run one after the other. The same action can be used multiple times in the same workflow. A workflow, just like an action, can either be launched manually, set up to run on a schedule or triggered through an API call.

> [!primary]
>
> Note that it is important to remember that **stages are run one after the other** in the order you planned them while **actions contained in a stage are all run all at the same time** regardless of the order. In short, the order of the actions inside a stage does not matter while the stages’ order inside a workflow does.
>

To create your first workflow, you'll need to head to the *Workflow* tab and click on **New Workflow**. Head to preferences or double-click on the header name to set a new name *Import Chicago Data*.

![DPE workflow 1](images/workflow-step1.png)

Let's start by defining two different stages by clicking on **Add a stage**. Then, add actions in each stage using the dropdown search selector following the screenshot provided as a guide for each stage.

![DPE workflow 2](images/workflow-step2.png)

After creating the workflow (**create**), press **Play**.

> [!primary]
>
> Please note that workflows might take a few minutes ⏳ to run when you launch them for the first time. The total time should not exceed 10 minutes - if it does, please reach out to our support team.
>

While the workflow is running, something you can do is **schedule it to run daily** using a trigger.

Head to the *Preferences* tab of your workflows and scroll to the Triggers widget on the bottom left side. Click **+Add**.

![DPE workflow 4](images/workflow-step3.png)

Select the trigger type as *CRON* and mode as *Simple*. Navigate to the **Daily** tab and in the list of options select *Every 1 day(s)* as shown in the picture below:

![DPE workflow 4](images/workflow-step4.png)

Hit the **Confirm** button to create the new trigger event with the name of your choice and it will append it below the *Launch Endpoint* present by default in the Trigger event table.

![DPE workflow 5](images/workflow-step5.png)

There is a lot more you can configure in a workflow's preferences. Namely, you can [scale horizontally and vertically](#/en/product/dpe/jobs/resources) any processing job, use [workload segmentation](#/en/getting-further/segmentation/index) to accelerate the data processing and even save all these configurations for repeated use thanks to [environments](#/en/product/dpe/environments/index).  
[Learn more about configuring the execution preferences.](#/en/product/dpe/actions/settings/index)

> [!primary]
>
> Make sure to click on the **Save** button on the top right of the screen whenever you make a modification to your workflows. Actions are stored in repositories which can be versioned which is not the case for workflows or environments. *Autosave* is therefore disabled for both workflows & environments.

### Jobs

To wrap up this section, here are a few words about the last tab of the Data Processing Engine component: jobs.

The Jobs tab summarizes **all executions triggered in the Data Processing Engine** and includes advanced metrics reports. Jobs are listed under three main categories: running, queued and past executions. Having a look at the last jobs executed, you can verify the status of the workflow you just launched.

You now have completed the Data Engineering section of the *Getting Started* tutorial 🌟

A good way to make sure your data properly loaded is to go back to the **Lakehouse Manager** and look at the number of rows loaded into the table. Just open the **list view mode** and check the *rows* column, if the field has a number (indicating how many rows have been loaded) then everything worked well.
