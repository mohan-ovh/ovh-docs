Managed Private Registries allow you to focus on using Harbor to host, share and manage your cloud native artifacts while OVHcloud takes care of the required software and hardware maintenance in operational conditions.

The RACI below details shared responsibilities between OVHcloud and the customer for Public Cloud Managed Private Registry services.
This shared model can help relieve the customer’s operational burden.
