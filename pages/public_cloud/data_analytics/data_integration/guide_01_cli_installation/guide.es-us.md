## Objective

This guide covers the installation of the **ovhdata-cli** command line interface (CLI). The CLI is the recommended means of interaction with the **Data Integration** service.

## Requirements

- An OVHcloud account with the associated credentials.
- A [Public Cloud project](https://www.ovhcloud.com/es/public-cloud/) in your OVHcloud account.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Download the CLI

Download the CLI corresponding to your operating system.

``` {.console}
# Linux
curl -s https://github.com/ovh/ovhdata-cli/releases/latest/download/ovhdata-cli_linux_amd64
```

``` {.console}
# Mac
curl -s https://github.com/ovh/ovhdata-cli/releases/latest/download/ovhdata-cli_darwin_amd64
```

``` {.console}
# Windows
curl -s https://github.com/ovh/ovhdata-cli/releases/latest/download/ovhdata-cli_windows_amd64.exe
```

### Step 2: Installing the CLI

After downloading the right binary for your platform, add it to your `PATH`:

``` {.console}
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
mv ovhdata-cli-<os-build> $HOME/bin/ovhdata-cli
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/
```

Optionally you could generate the CLI completion script and add it to your settings.
Here is an example for `bash` though other shells are supported:

``` {.console}
ovhdata-cli completion bash > ~/ovhdata-cli-completion.sh
echo 'source ~/ovhdata-cli-completion.sh' > ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

You should now be able to use the tabulation to complete your commands as you type.

> [!primary]
> You may have to regenerate the completion script after updating the CLI to a version supporting new commands.

### Step 3: Authenticating

Once the **ovhdata-cli** CLI is installed, you need to authenticate.

``` {.console}
ovhdata-cli login
```

The above command will open your browser and ask you to login.
Fill in your OVHcloud account credentials, submit and then click on continue:

### Step 4: Creating API keys

Once authenticated on your browser you will have to create API keys.

- Set the application name.
- Set the application description.
- Choose the validity period.
- Pick the following rights: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE, all four on `/*`.

### Step 5: Completing the authentication

Go back to your terminal and use your newly created API keys to complete the CLI authentication process:

- First copy the `application key` from your browser and paste it.
- Then copy the `secret key` from your browser and paste it (it will be considered as a password and will not be displayed).
- Finally copy the `consumer key` from your browser and paste it.

You should receive a feedback message informing you that you are now logged in.

Finalize the login process by setting the service name corresponding to your Public Cloud project identifier:

``` {.console}
ovhdata-cli config set-service-name a7b3ecad6e4a52b0b33dfd5ba7eb4199
```

### Step 6: Using the command line CLI

You can use the command `ovhdata-cli --help` to list generic CLI actions, `ovhdata-cli di --help` to list actions specific to the Data Integration service, and `ovhdata-cli di <action> --help` for more information about a specific action.

Please refer to the [CLI commands reference guide](/pages/public_cloud/data_analytics/data_integration/guide_02_cli_commands_reference) for more information.
