### Step 3: Confirm two-factor authentication.

Scan the QR code via your OTP application. In the field to the right of the QR code, enter the code given by the application. You can also add a description of this authentication method. This may be useful if you want to identify the people able to use this method on your account.

### Step 4: Save the emergency security codes.

When you first add a two-factor authentication security method, you will be sent emergency codes, which need to be stored in a safe place. We recommend saving them in a password manager.

You can delete or regenerate them via the OVHcloud Control Panel:

### Step 5: Log in to the OVHcloud Control Panel via two-factor authentication.
