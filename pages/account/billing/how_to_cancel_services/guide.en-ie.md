## Objective

You want to cancel one or more OVHcloud services. This guide will show you how to cancel your subscription via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie).

First of all, read the section "[What happens when an OVHcloud service is cancelled?](#consequences)". Then select the concerned product in the section "[How do I cancel my subscription?](#terminate)".

> [!primary]
>
> Getting your opinion is essential for us. This means we can develop our services to suit your needs and expectations.
>
> Please tell us more about your personal experience with OVHcloud by filling in the cancellation form. We thank you in advance for your contribution to the improvement of our products.
>

## What happens when an OVHcloud service is cancelled? <a name="consequences"></a>

When an OVHcloud service is cancelled, it will be interrupted **permanently** when the current subscription ends (with an exception, however, for [domain names](#domain)). You can cancel your service or [stop a cancellation request](#cancel) up to 24 hours before the subscription end date.

If this is an email solution, a server or Web Hosting plan, all of the data concerned will be deleted **without any possibility of recovery**.

If it is a domain name or a telephone number, it will be recirculated and therefore might be **ordered by other customers**.

This means that, before any termination, you must be **certain** that:

- The operation will only affect a service you no longer want to use.
- You have a *functional* solution to replace it, if necessary.
- You have backed up all of the data concerned, if required.

## How do I cancel my subscription? <a name="terminate"></a>

> [!warning]
>
> Termination can only be applied if the following conditions are met:
>
> - You are the "administrative contact" for the service (for more information, see [this guide](/pages/account/customer/managing_contacts#definition)).
> - The service is not manually renewed.
> - The service is not suspended, particularly because an invoice has not been paid.
