## Using web interface

First, connect to the [Cloud Disk Array manager](https://www.ovh.com/manager/cloud/index.html){.external}. Under 'Platforms and services' select your Ceph cluster. On the bottom left, you will find the **user list**. No user is created by default (except *admin* that you can't use and that is hidden).

Enter a username.

> Your username needs at least three characters.

After user creation, you are back to manager. You can see that cluster status has changed because the user is being created.

## Using API

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/user
>
serviceName is the fsid of your cluster.

You can check user creation by listing users.

```bash
GET /dedicated/ceph/98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15/user
[
  {
    mdsCaps: ""
    monCaps: "allow r"
    serviceName: "98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15"
    name: "myuser"
    osdCaps: "allow class-read object_prefix rbd_children"
    key: "AQA9KpdXoBrDNhAAFCM7m/XOtmWh3LMSNlHVqw=="
  }
]
```
