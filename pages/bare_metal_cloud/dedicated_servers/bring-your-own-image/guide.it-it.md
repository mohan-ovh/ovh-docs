excerpt: Find out how to easily deploy your own images on dedicated servers

## Objective

The Bring Your Own Image feature (BYOI) enables you to deploy *cloudready* images directly on your dedicated server. You can therefore use the bare metal service as a resource for your deployments.

**What does *cloudready* mean?**

The *cloudready* standard generally means being agnostic of the infrastructure on which the image is deployed.
In addition to the requirement and limitations mentioned below, you must ensure that the image (downloaded or generated) answers correctly to the definition of technical expectations of a cloudready image.

**This guide explains how to use Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) on your OVHcloud dedicated server.**

## Requirements

- A [dedicated server](https://www.ovhcloud.com/it/bare-metal/) in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.it/&ovhSubsidiary=it) (for the "[Deployment via Control Panel](#viacontrolpanel)" method)
- Access to the [OVHcloud API](/pages/manage_and_operate/api/first-steps) (for the "[Deployment via API](#viaapi)" section of this guide)
- Your image must be smaller than the Server RAM minus 3GiB

> [!warning]
>
> As with any classical OS installation, a new installation with BYOI will erase all the data on the server.
>

## Instructions

**Technical limitations:**

There are some technical limitations linked to the use of physical products such as dedicated servers. Here is a non-exhaustive list, to keep in mind during your deployment preparation:

- Boot type: **uefi** or **legacy**
- Partition type: **MBR** or **GPT**
- Image format: **qcow2** or **raw**

> [!warning]
> **About RAID:**
>
> - Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) does not support software RAID configuration at install-time, but you can use the service [Bring Your Own Linux (BYOLinux)](/pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/bring-your-own-linux) for that. Choose the custom image method that fits your needs: [Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) / Bring Your Own Linux (BYOLinux), a comparison sheet](pages/bare_metal_cloud/dedicated_servers/bring-your-own-image-versus-bring-your-own-linux).
>
> - Hardware RAID is supported, if your server supports it, because it is configured before the image is deployed on disk.
>

**Deployment methods:**

- [Deployment via the Control Panel](#viacontrolpanel): allows you to simply deploy your image using the OVHcloud Control Panel.
- [Deployment via API](#viaapi): you can use the OVHcloud API to integrate images into your own scripts to automate deployments.

### Deploy your image via the Control Panel <a name="viacontrolpanel"></a>

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.it/&ovhSubsidiary=it) and go to the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} section, then select your server under `Dedicated servers`{.action}.

In the `General information`{.action} tab, click the `...`{.action} button next to "System (OS)" then click `Install`{.action}.

![BringYourOwnImage Control Panel 01](images/byoi-controlpanel01.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that appears, select `Install from an OVHcloud template`{.action} and click `Next`{.action}.

![BringYourOwnImage Control Panel 02](images/byoi-controlpanel02.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that appears, select `Custom` in the menu, then `Bring Your Own Image - byoi`, and click `Next`{.action}.

![BringYourOwnImage Control Panel 03](images/byoi-controlpanel03.png){.thumbnail}

You will be redirected to the configuration page. Make sure your image URL is in the correct format. Complete the rest of the required fields on this page. Once you have confirmed that the information is correct, click `Confirm`{.action}.

You can find more details on the options in the [deployment options](#options) section below.

For more information and examples about Cloud-Init's ConfigDrive, please read the official documentation on [this page](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/22.1_a/topics/examples.html).

### Deploy your image via the APIs <a name="viaapi"></a>

Log in to the [API console](https://api.ovh.com/) and go to the `/dedicated/server`{.action} section.

> [!api]
>
> @api {v1} /dedicated/server POST /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/install/start
>

The Bring Your Own Image (BYOI) payload should be similar to the following:

> [!warning]
>
> In the `userMetadata` section, only `imageURL` and `imageType` are mandatory.
>

```json
{
  "details": {
    "customHostname": "myCustomBYOI"
  },
  "templateName": "byoi_64",
  "userMetadata": [
    {
      "key": "imageURL",
      "value": "https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/cloud/bullseye/20230124-1270/debian-11-generic-amd64-20230124-1270.raw"
    },
    {
      "key": "imageType",
      "value": "raw"
    },
    {
      "key": "httpHeaders0Key",
      "value": "Authorization"
    },
    {
      "key": "httpHeaders0Value",
      "value": "Basic bG9naW46cGFzc3dvcmQ="
    },
    {
      "key": "imageCheckSum",
      "value": "2cbd3dd5606ef95a5cfa47943b3ad453fcc43522915be7f559a296a71395f82f88e621e558df7aa5f3d2e62c20043f9430ad18c900e565a1c070066e8d008aaa"
    },
    {
      "key": "imageCheckSumType",
      "value": "sha512"
    },
    {
      "key": "configDriveUserData",
      "value": "#!/bin/bash\necho \"Hi, sounds that BYOI is a success!\" > /etc/motd\n"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you completed the fields, start the deployment by clicking `Execute`{.action}.

#### Deployment options <a name="options"></a>

| userMetadata/httpHeaders?Key | HTTP Headers key  | ❌² |
| userMetadata/httpHeaders?Value | HTTP Headers value | ❌² |

¹ Can either be a `#cloud-config` or a script. It must be in one-line, and have `\n` for line-return<br />
² Use only if you need HTTP Headers, such as `Basic Auth`<br />

> [!primary]
>
> The ConfigDrive partition is used by cloud-init during the first server boot in order to apply your configurations. You can choose whether you want to use the default one, or a custom one (using `configDriveUserData`).
