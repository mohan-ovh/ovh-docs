## What happens when an OVHcloud service is cancelled? <a name="consequences"></a>

When an OVHcloud service is cancelled, it will be interrupted **permanently** when the current subscription ends (with an exception, however, for [domain names](#domain)). You can cancel your service or [stop a cancellation request](#cancel) up to 24 hours before the subscription end date.

If this is an email solution, a server or Web Hosting plan, all of the data concerned will be deleted **without any possibility of recovery**.

If it is a domain name or a telephone number, it will be recirculated and therefore might be **ordered by other customers**.

This means that, before any termination, you must be **certain** that:

- The operation will only affect a service you no longer want to use.
- You have a *functional* solution to replace it, if necessary.
- You have backed up all of the data concerned, if required.

## How do I cancel my subscription? <a name="terminate"></a>

> [!warning]
>
> Termination can only be applied if the following conditions are met:
>
> - You are the "administrative contact" for the service (for more information, see [this guide](/pages/account/customer/managing_contacts#definition)).
> - The service is not manually renewed.
> - The service is not suspended, particularly because an invoice has not been paid.
