## Objective

Find the most frequently asked questions about the OVHcloud support.

### What should I do if I can't reach support by phone?

To avoid waiting on the phone, please create a support request via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg). A contact form is available in the banner on the right at the bottom, via the “Create a ticket” link.

You can also refer to our documentation (FAQs, guides, diagnostic tools, etc.) in the Help Centre.

### Why has the ticket creation form changed?

The aim of this new form is to make the ticket creation process more comprehensive and accurate, with a questionnaire. This means we can classify your requests more efficiently in accordance with the service type, your support requirements, and how critical they are. It also avoids time-consuming back-and-forth between you and our teams.

### Where can I find my support level?

The level of support linked to your NIC handle is listed on the dashboard in the OVHcloud Control Panel, below your initials. If you have not signed up to a paid support service, you will have the Standard level by default.

Explore and compare the different support levels available [here](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/support-levels/).

### Why has OVHcloud changed its customer support?

OVHcloud has done this to enhance the experience it offers. Our new support structure is designed to meet growing customer expectations, with quicker replies to questions and even higher service quality.

This is why OVHcloud is now offering a wider, more accurate support system that suits business needs, and provides customers with access to online autonomous management services.
