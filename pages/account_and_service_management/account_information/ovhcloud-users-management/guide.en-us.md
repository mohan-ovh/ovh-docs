## Objective

With OVHcloud, you can create additional users with read or write access to your customer account. This means that you can grant other members of your company access to your OVHcloud services, without having to resort to risky practices like sharing passwords or two-factor authentication details.

> [!primary]
>
> User management is different to contact management. A user will have an access to all sections of the OVHcloud Control Panel according to the level of rights he's granted.
>
> The purpose of contact management is to delegate full management of the administrative, technical and billing aspects of one or more services on your OVHcloud account. For further information on contact management, please refer to [this guide](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/managing_contacts).

**This guide details the privileges a user can hold, as well as the method for adding and managing users.**

## Requirements

## Instructions

### User management

#### Add a user

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/world/&ovhSubsidiary=we), click `your name`{.action} (1) in the top right-hand corner, then click on your initials (2).

| Field | Details |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ID | Enter the user’s name or their role, for example. |
| Email | Enter the user’s full email address. |
| Password | Set the user password. The user can then change this password once their access has been created. <br>We also suggest reading our [guide on password management](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/manage-ovh-password) to define this password. |
| Group | Choose a group from those available. |
| Description | You can add a user description (such as their role within the company). |

The user then gets their own ID made up of your account’s numeric ID (which is listed in the “User management” menu) and their username, with the two values separated by a “/”.

Example: **1234-567-89/johnsmith**.

The user you have created can then log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/world/&ovhSubsidiary=we) using this ID. 

They can also change their password and secure their own access to your account by enabling two-factor authentication (this is only for their access as a user). To find out how to enable two-factor authentication, you can refer to [this guide](/pages/account_and_service_management/account_information/secure-ovhcloud-account-with-2fa).

#### Manage users

You can disable/enable or remove a user by clicking on the `…`{.action} button to the right of the user’s name.
