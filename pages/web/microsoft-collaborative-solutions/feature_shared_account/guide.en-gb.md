## Objective

A **shared account** is a mailbox shared between several Exchange accounts and can only be accessed through them. A shared account does not have a password. It is therefore necessary to delegate its access to one or more Exchange accounts of the same service.
<br>Shared accounts can be accessed via delegation from OWA (Exchange webmail) or via Outlook email software.

**This guide explains how to create and manage a shared account on your Exchange platform.**

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)
- an [OVHcloud Exchange solution](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/emails/hosted-exchange/)

## Instructions

### Adding a shared account

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB). Go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section and select your service under `Microsoft`{.action}, then `Exchange`{.action}.

Select the `Shared accounts`{.action} tab in the horizontal menu and click on `Add a shared account`{.action}.

Fill in the requested fields:

|Field|Description|
|---|---|
|Email account|Choose the name of your shared account. **This must not be an existing email address.**|
|Quota|Enter the storage quota you want for your shared account. The maximum quota is **10 GB for all of your shared accounts**.|
|Display name|The display name you want to appear when sending from your shared account.|
|Hide the address in the directory|By hiding the address in the directory you can ensure that the shared account is not visible in the address list of your Exchange service.|

Click `Next`{.action} to proceed to the summary. Complete the operation by clicking on `Confirm`{.action}.

### Managing the delegation of a shared account

Once you have created your shared account, you will need to grant access permissions to one or more accounts of the Exchange service.

A shared account cannot be accessed directly because it does not have a password. It cannot be configured directly in an Outlook client, or accessed via webmail.

You will need to set up a delegation between an Exchange account and the shared account.

In the `Shared accounts`{.action} tab of your Exchange service, click on the `...`{.action} button next to the shared account, then click `Manage  delegations`{.action}. You can then choose which accounts can access the shared account.

Choose the permissions for the selected account:

|Permission|Description|
|---|---|
|"Send As" permission|Allows the selected email account to send an email as the shared email address.|
|"Send on Behalf" permission|Allows the selected email account to send on behalf of the shared email address.|
|Access permission|Allows the selected email account to view and manage the shared account from OWA or Outlook.|

Then click `Next`{.action} and `Confirm`{.action} to save the changes.

In our example, we allow the accounts **guide-exchange@** and **test@** to access **shared_test@**.
<br>The account **guide-exchange@** will also have the right to send mails "as" **shared_test@**.
<br>The account **test@** can also send emails "on behalf of" **shared_test@**.

### Using the account shared from OWA (webmail)

Log in to [webmail](https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail/) with an Exchange account that has access to the shared account.
<br>In our example, we connect with the **guide-exchange@** account.

Once you have logged in, right-click on the main tree for your email address in the left-hand column. Select `Add shared folder...`{.action} from the context menu.

Enter the name of your shared account and click `Add`{.action} when it is found in the Exchange directory.

In our example, the shared account is now accessible from the **guide-exchange@** account.

### Using the shared account from Outlook

In the Outlook application, you will see your shared account in the left-hand column in the same way as in OWA.
