## Objective

By creating an alias for your email address, you can give out a "concealment" address to your contacts, without having to disclose your personal email address to the sender. One email account can have multiple aliases.

For example, your email address is **john.smith@mydomain.ovh** and you create an alias named **anonymous@mydomain.ovh**. You can then provide the address **anonymous@mydomain.ovh** to your contacts and receive your emails on **john.smith@mydomain.ovh** without the sender having knowledge of **john.smith@mydomain.ovh**.

**This guide explains how to add an alias address to an email account in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**

> [!warning]
>
> Please note: OVHcloud aliases only work for incoming emails. It is not possible to send emails using the alias as the sender of an email.

## Requirements

- access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)
- an email service with OVHcloud: [**Exchange**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/emails/hosted-exchange/){.external}, [**Email Pro**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/emails/email-pro/){.external} or **MX Plan** (new version only, included in an [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/){.external} or ordered separately as a standalone solution)

## Instructions

### Creating an alias

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB), and go to the `Web Cloud` section. Then choose the menu section coresponding to your email solution:

- **Exchange**: Open `Microsoft`{.action}, then `Exchange`{.action}, and select the service concerned. Click on the `Email accounts`{.action} tab.

- **Email Pro**: Open `Email Pro`{.action}, select the service concerned, then click on the `Email accounts`{.action} tab.

- **Emails** (MXplan): Open `Emails`{.action}, select the service concerned, then click on the `Email accounts`{.action} tab.

In the table that appears, you will see an `Alias` column.

> [!warning]
>
> If you have an MXplan email solution and the Alias column does not appear, you are using the **legacy version** of the service. In this case, the aliases are created as redirections. To do this, please refer to our guide on [Using email redirections](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/emails/email-redirection-guide/#mx-plan-legacy-version) .
