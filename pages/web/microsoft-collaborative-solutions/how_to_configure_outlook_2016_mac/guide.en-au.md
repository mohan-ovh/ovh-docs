## Instructions

### Step 1: Add the account

Once you have launched Outlook on your device, you can add an account in two different ways:

- **When you start the application for the first time:** A setup wizard will appear and prompt you to enter your email address.

- **If you have already added an account:** Click `Tools`{.action} in the menu bar at the top of your screen, then `Accounts`{.action}. In the window that pops up, click `+`{.action}, then `New account`{.action}.

Enter your email address, then click `Continue`{.action}. If you are asked to choose a provider, select `Exchange`{.action}. Then fill in the information requested.

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Method|Leave **Username and password** (selected by default).|
|Mail address|Enter a name that will distinguish this account from any other accounts added in Outlook.|
|DOMAIN\username or email address|Enter your full email address.|
|Password|Enter the password for your email address.|
|Server|Depending on the DNS configuration for your domain name, you may not need to enter the server. If you do, enter the details for the server your Exchange service is hosted on. You will find these details in your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external} by going to the `General information`{.action} tab for the Exchange service concerned, then the `Connection`{.action} section.|

Once you have entered this information, click `Add account`{.action}. If the information is correct, Outlook will successfully connect to the account.

To check that the account has been properly configured, you can send a test email.
