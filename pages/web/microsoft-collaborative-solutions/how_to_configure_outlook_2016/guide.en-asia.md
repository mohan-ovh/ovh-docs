## Instructions

### Step 1: Add the account

Once you have launched Outlook on your device, you can add an account in two different ways:

- **When you start the application for the first time**: A setup wizard will appear and prompt you to enter your email address.

- **If you have already added an account:** Click `File`{.action} in the menu bar at the top of your screen, then `Add account`{.action}.

Enter your email address, then click `Advanced options`{.action}. Tick the box that appears next to `Configure my account manually`{.action}, then click `Connection`{.action}. Select **Exchange** from the list of account types.

A security window will pop up and ask you to enter the **password** for the email address. Enter the password, tick the ‘remember password’ box and click on `OK`{.action}.

> If you get a message saying that Outlook was unable to configure your account, this may mean that the OVH SRV field has not been set up correctly in your domain name's DNS area.
>
> We recommend that you check the domain name configuration for your Exchange service in your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, in the`Associated domains`{.action} tab, then the Diagnostic column of the table.
>

If the domain name configuration is correct, a message will appear asking you to authorise a connection to the OVH server. Accept this connection in order to allow your Exchange account to be configured automatically.

Once your account has been correctly configured and can be accessed via Outlook 2016, you can send a test email to check that it works correctly.

### Step 2: Use the email address

OVH offers a web application that includes various [collaborative features](https://www.ovh.co.uk/emails/){.external}, You can access this application at <https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail/>. You can log in using your email credentials.
