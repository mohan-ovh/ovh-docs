## Instructions

There are two ways of adding your email address to the Mail app:

- **Via our Apple Devices tool:** Click on the following link and follow the configuration steps: <https://autodiscover.mail.ovh.net/AppleDevices/>

- **Via your device’s configuration assistant.**

From this point onwards, this guide will only cover email configuration using your device's configuration assistant.

### Step 1: Add the account

On your device’s homepage, go to `Settings`{.action}. There are two ways of adding an account, depending on which version of iOS you are using:

- **For iOS 7, 8, 9 and 10:** Go to `Mail, Contacts, Calendar`{.action}, then `Add account`{.action}. Choose `Exchange`{.action}.

- **For iOS 11:** Go to `Accounts and passwords`{.action}, then `Add account`{.action}. Choose `Exchange.`{.action}

Enter your account information:

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Email address|Enter your full email address.|
|Description|Enter a name that will distinguish this account from any others you have added to your Mail app.|

Then click `Next`{.action}, and choose `Configure manually`{.action}.

Enter your email password, then click `Next`{.action}.

Enter the following information:

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Email address|This field should be filled in automatically. If it is not, enter your full email address.|
|Server|Enter the details for the server your Exchange service is hosted on. You will find these details in your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external} by going to the `General information`{.action} tab for the Exchange service concerned, then the `Connection`{.action} section.|
|Domain|Leave this field blank.|
|Username|Enter your full email address.|  
|Password|This field should be filled in automatically. If it is not, enter the password for your email address.|
|Description|This field should be filled in automatically. If it is not, enter a name that will distinguish this account from any others added to your Mail app.|

Then click `Next`{.action}. If all the information you have entered is correct, you will be able to log in to your account straight away.

When you choose the applications you would like to link to your email address, ensure that `Mail`{.action} is ticked. This will ensure that the application will work correctly with your email address. Other applications (e.g. Calendar and Notes) can use some of Exchange’s collaborative features, so you should also tick any others you would like to make use of in this way. Once you have done so, click `Save`{.action}.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email.

### Step 2: Use the email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it to send and receive emails straight away!

OVH also offers a web application, with further [collaborative features](https://www.ovh.co.uk/emails/){.external}. Follow this link, and log in with your email credentials: <https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail/>.
