## Objective

[Zonemaster](https://zonemaster.net/en/run-test) is a tool created by the collaboration between [AFNIC](https://www.afnic.fr/en/) (French registry) and [The Swedish Internet Foundation](https://internetstiftelsen.se/en/) (Swedish registry). It allows you to analyse the Domain Name System (DNS) configuration of a domain name and identify what can be improved or corrected.

> To get a better understanding of DNS, please read the introduction to our guide on [configuring a DNS zone](/pages/web/domains/dns_zone_edit).


## Requirements

- A [domain name](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/domains/)

## Instructions

### Input field

The Zonemaster tool allows you to check a DNS configuration in place on a domain name or to test a preconfigured DNS zone on future DNS servers.

To check the current configuration of a domain name, enter your domain name, then click `Check`{.action}.

To check a DNS configuration that has been prepared but not yet applied to the domain name concerned, select the `Options`{.action} box, and then enter the following information:

- **Nameservers**: Enter the information for the DNS server associated with a domain name, then click the `+`{.action} button to confirm your entry. Entering an IP address is optional.
- **Delegation Signers (DS records)**: If DNSSEC protection applies, enter the DS record items here, then click `+`{.action} to add the record. If the DNS servers do not use the DNSSEC protocol, you can leave these fields empty.

You can also force checks on a specific IP protocol by using the `Disable IPv6` and `Disable IPv4` checkboxes.

> **Example**:<br><br> You have the domain name mydomain.ovh, which currently uses the DNS servers "dns19.ovh.net" and "ns19.ovh.net". 
>
> You have configured a DNS zone for this domain name on the DNS servers "mydns.test.ovh" and "mydns2.test.ovh".<br>
> Before you change the DNS servers, you can perform an advanced search by enabling `Options`{.action}, then entering "mydns.test.ovh" and "mydns2.test.ovh" into the `Nameservers` fields.<br>
> Zonemaster will perform a test as if you were using the servers "mydns.test.ovh" and "mydns2.test.ovh" on mydomain.ovh.<br>

>
> When you enter a domain name and click on `Fetch data from parent zone`{.action}, the DNS servers associated with the domain name will appear, along with the DNS record information (DNSSEC) if it has been configured.

### Result

Once the form has been validated, the results are sorted by colour code:

- **Green**: This part is functional and meets the standard criteria in its category.
- **Orange**: This part is functional, but deserves special attention. The tool has detected that this parameter has characteristics that do not fit within its category, without blocking its operation.
- **Red**: This part contains errors or missing elements that may cause a malfunction. 
- **Blue**: This is merely information, with no particular consequences for the functioning of the domain name.
