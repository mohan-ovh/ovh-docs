## Domains & DNS FAQ

### How do I configure my DNS zone? 

With your websiteâ€™s domain name, you can configure its DNS zone. To do this, log into the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external} and select the `Domains` section, then click on your domain name and the `DNS zone`{.action} tab. 

On the right-hand side of the DNS zone page are several possible actions, such as `Creating/Modifying/Deleting records`{.action}. 

**Tips and tricks**: If you make a mistake, you can reset your DNS zone via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}. To do this, you can use the following documentation: [Editing an OVHcloud DNS zone](../web_hosting_how_to_edit_my_dns_zone).
