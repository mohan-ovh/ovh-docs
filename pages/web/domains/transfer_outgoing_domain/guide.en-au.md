## Instructions

### Step 1: Remove the transfer protection for the domain name

To remove the transfer protection for your OVH domain name, when you are logged in to your [Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, click `Web`{.action} in the service bar at the top. Go to the `Domains`{.action} section on the left, then click on the domain name in question. In the `General information`{.action} tab, untick the `Protection against domain name transfer`{.action} box, then click `Confirm`{.action}.

> Once you have unlocked your domain name, you will have seven days to begin transferring it to the new registrar. After this seven-day period, your domain will be automatically locked again if you do not submit a request to change your domain name registrar.

### Step 3: Launch the transfer to the new registrar

If you have not already done so, contact your new registrar to begin the transfer of your domain name. You will need to provide the transfer code retrieved during step 3 as part of the process, which is different for each registrar.

Consult the information provided by your new registrar to find out how long the transfer will take.
