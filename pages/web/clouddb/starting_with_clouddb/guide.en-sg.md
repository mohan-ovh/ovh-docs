## Objective

With the Web Cloud Databases solution, you get a database instance with dedicated, guaranteed resources that gives you performance and flexibility.
Your Web Cloud Databases solution is linked to the OVHcloud web hosting network by default. You can link it to any other network, via a list of authorised IP addresses.

**Find out how to get started with a Web Cloud Databases service.**

## Requirements

- A [Web Cloud Databases instance](https://www.ovh.ie/cloud-databases/) (included in [Performance web hosting plans](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-sg/web-hosting/)).
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg)

## Instructions

### Web Cloud Databases server activation included with your Web Hosting plan

If your hosting plan includes the Web Cloud Databases option, go to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg){.external}. In the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click `Hosting plans`{.action} in the left-hand column.

### Create a database

> [!primary]
>
> This step does not apply to the Redis database system.
>

To create your first database on your Web Cloud Databases instance, click on the `Databases`{.action} tab, then on the `Add a database`{.action} button.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-database.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that pops up, and at the same time as you create the database, you can choose to:

-  **Create a user**: this user will be able to submit requests to your database (such as reading, adding or deleting data).

- **Add an authorised IP address**: requests coming from this address will be allowed to access your database.

Fill in the information requested depending on what you choose to do, and click `Confirm`{.action}.

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Database name|This is the name of your future database.|
|Username|This is the user that can log in to your database and perform requests (optional if the “*Create a user*” box has not been ticked).|
|Permissions|These are the permissions that will be associated with the user. For standard usage, select `Administrator`{.action} (optional if the “*Create a user*” box has not been ticked).|
|Password|Select a password, then confirm it (optional if the “*Create a user*” box has not been ticked).|
|IP/mask|This is the IP address or the IP mask for the server(s) that is/are authorised to access your databases (optional if the “*Add an authorised IP address*” box has not been ticked). |

### Create a user

> [!primary]
>
> This step does not apply to the Redis database system.
>

If you created a user whilst creating a database in the previous step, this step is optional. However, for more specific projects, you may need several users to be able to access your database. For example, one user associated with a database may need to have read and write permissions, whilst another may need only read permissions.

If you do not need an additional user for your project, you can move straight to the following step. If you do need to create a user in your Web Cloud Databases instance, you can click on the `Users and permissions`{.action} tab, then on the `Add a user`{.action} button.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-user.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that pops up, fill in the information requested, and click `Confirm`{.action}.

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Username|This is the user that can log in to your instance. You can give them permissions on your database in the next step.|
|Password|Enter a password, then confirm it.|

> [!warning]
>
> For security reasons, please follow the conditions required when you enter information.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-user-step2.png){.thumbnail}

Once you have created a user, you will need to assign rights that allow them to perform actions on your database (such as reading, adding or deleting data). To do this, click on the cog wheel icon, then `Manage rights`{.action}. On the new page, select the right by clicking on it. For standard usage, select Administrator.

### Import a database

> [!primary]
>
> This step applies if you want to import the backup of an existing database. Otherwise, please go to the next step.
>

There are several methods you can choose from to import a database. There is a tool available in your OVHcloud Control Panel, and we are going to focus on this method. However, you may of course use another method, if you prefer to do so and are familiar with it.

The steps below show how to import a database using the tool available in your OVHcloud Control Panel.

#### Step 1: Access the import interface.

Go to the `Databases`{.action} tab, click on the cog wheel icon, then `Import a file`{.action}. On the window that opens, tick the `Import a new file`{.action} box, then click `Next`{.action}.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-import-step1.png){.thumbnail}

#### Step 2: Select and send the backup file.

Enter a filename that will allow you to identify this backup later, if you want to restore it again. Then, next to **File**, select the database backup file from your computer, and click `Send`{.action}. Wait until the interface confirms that the file has been sent successfully, then click `Next`{.action}.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-import-step2.png){.thumbnail}

#### Step 3: Launch the database importation.

Finally, choose whether or not the additional options set out below should apply, and click `Confirm`{.action}.

|Additional options|Description|
|---|---|
|Empty the current database|The content in the database will be deleted entirely, and replaced by the content in your backup.|
|Send an email once the importation is complete|You will be sent an email notification when the database import is complete.|

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-import-step3.png){.thumbnail} 

### Authorise an IP address <a name="trustip"></a>

In order for your Web Cloud Databases instance to be accessible, you must enter the IP addresses or ranges that can connect to your database. To do this, click on the `Authorised IPs`{.action} tab, then click `Add an IP address/mask`{.action}.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-ip-2022.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that pops up, enter the IP address or mask that you wish to authorise in `IP/mask`{.action} together with a description if you wish. You can then decide if you want to grant access to the databases only, or to the SFTP as well. Finally, click `Confirm`{.action}.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-ip-step2.png){.thumbnail}

#### Authorise the connection for an OVHcloud Web Hosting plan <a name="trustip"></a>

By default, your Web Cloud Databases solution is automatically linked to OVHcloud web hosting plans. However, you can disable access to your Web Cloud Databases database for OVHcloud web hosting plans if you wish.

To do this, click on the `authorised IPs`{.action} tab then on the `Access to OVHcloud web hosting plans`{.action} button.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-add-ip-step3-2022.png){.thumbnail}

### Link your website to the database

Now that you have created your database, created one or more users with access to it, and authorised at least one IP address or OVHcloud web hosting plans on your Web Cloud Databases instance, you just need to link your website to your database. You can use several methods to do this, depending on your website, the CMS you are using (WordPress, Joomla! etc.), or the stage you are at if you are setting up a website.

No matter which method you choose to follow, you must have the following five pieces of information to hand, to ensure that you do this successfully:

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Database name|The name you entered when you created your database. You can view all the databases created in your Web Cloud Databases instance under the `Databases`{.action} tab.|
|Username|The name of the user you entered when you created the database, or the name of an additional user that you created at a later stage. You can view all the users created in your Web Cloud Databases instance under the `Users and permissions`{.action} tab.|
|User password|The password associated with the user, which was defined during the previous steps.|
|Server hostname|The server that needs to be entered for your website to be connected to your database. You can access this information in your Control Panel by going to the `Connections`{.action} section, then the General information tab.|
|Server port|The port for connecting to your Web Cloud Databases instance, so that your website can connect to your database. You can access this information in your Control Panel by going to the `Connections`{.action} section, then the `General information`{.action} tab.|

> [!warning]
>
> In some rare cases, the `port`{.action} field may not be available in your website’s configuration. If this is the case, you will need to add this field after your server’s host name, separating them with a *:*, i.e. `hostname:port`.
>

### Retrieve your Web Cloud Databases server logs

To check your database’s latest logs, go to the `Logs`{.action} tab of your Web Cloud Databases server. This tab displays alerts and errors in real time.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-log01.png){.thumbnail}

To retrieve all logs for your Web Cloud Databases server, log in via SFTP on it.

> [!warning]
>
> Before logging in, check that the IP address of the workstation you are using is authorised on your Web Cloud Databases server, with the `SFTP` option ticked. Use the [Authorise connection to an OVHcloud web hosting plan](#trustip) section of this guide.

You can find the SFTP login details in the `General information`{.action} tab of your Web Cloud Databases server. If you do not know the `Server password`, click the `...`{.action} button on the right to modify it.

![Web Cloud Databases](images/web-cloud-databases-log02.png){.thumbnail}

Log in via an FTP client (FileZilla, Cyberduck, WinSCP, etc.).

For FileZilla, in the `File`{.action} menu, go to the `Site Manager`{.action}. Click `New Site`{.action}, and enter the settings you have listed.
