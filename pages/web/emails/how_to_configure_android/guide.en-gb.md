## Instructions

### Step 1: Add the account

On your device’s homepage, open the `Gmail`{.action} app. You can add an account in two different ways:

- **If no account has been set:** Tap through the welcome screen, and tap `Add email address`{.action}. Next, choose `Other`{.action}. 

- **If an account has already been set:** Tap the three-line icon on the top left-hand corner, then the arrow icon to the right of the of the account name that has already been set. Next, tap `Add account`{.action}, and choose `Other`{.action}.

Enter your email address, then click `Next`{.action}.

When you choose your account type, we recommend selecting **IMAP**. However, you can still select **POP**. Please note that if you choose this, your emails will be stored locally on your Gmail app, so this is not a recommended option if you check your emails using a variety of email applications.

Enter your email password, then click `Next`{.action}.

Enter the incoming server settings:

|Information|Description| 
|---|---| 
|Username|Enter your full email address.|  
|Password|Enter the password for your email address.|
|Server|Enter the server “ssl0.ovh.net”.|

Tap `Next`{.action}, then enter the outgoing server settings:

|Information|Description| 
|---|---| 
|Request a connection|Ensure that this button is enabled.|
|Username|Enter your full email address.|  
|Password|Enter the password for your email address.|
|SMTP server|Enter the server “ssl0.ovh.net”.|

Then tap `Next`{.action}. If all the information you have entered is correct, you will be able to log in to your account straight away.

Enter the account options, then tap `Next`{.action}. You can now set a name for this account, so that it can be distinguished from any other accounts associated with your app. You can also set the display name, which will appear when you send emails. Once you have done this, tap `Next`{.action}.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email.

If you need to enter any settings manually in your account preferences, the technical settings you will need to use with our MX Plan solution are listed below:

- **for IMAP configuration**

|Server type|Server name|Security type|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|ssl0.ovh.net|SSL/TLS|993|
|Outgoing|ssl0.ovh.net|SSL/TLS|465|

- **for POP configuration**

|Server type|Server name|Security type|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|ssl0.ovh.net|SSL/TLS|995|
|Outgoing|ssl0.ovh.net|SSL/TLS|465|

### Step 2: Use the email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it! You can now send and receive emails.

OVH also has a web application you can use to access your email account from your browser, via the following address: <https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail/>. You can log in using your email credentials.
