## Objective

With the OVHcloud MX Plan, you can send and receive emails from third-party software or via webmail. OVHcloud provides an online email service called RoundCube that allows you to access an email account via a web browser.

**Find out how to use the RoundCube webmail interface for your OVHcloud email addresses**

## Requirements

- An OVHcloud **MX Plan** email solution, included in our [web hosting plans](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/), included in a free [Start10M](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/domains/free-web-hosting/) hosting plan, or ordered separately as a standalone solution.
- Access to the MX Plan email account you would like to use; for more information, please refer to our guide [Getting started with an MX Plan](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/emails/web_hosting_an_overview_of_ovh_email/).

## Instructions

### Logging in to RoundCube

Go to the page <https://www.ovh.co.uk/mail/>. Enter your email address and password, then click `Login`{.action}.

> [!warning]
> 
> If you are redirected to an **O**utlook **W**eb **A**ccess (OWA) interface, this means that you are on the latest version of the MX Plan solution. To find out more about your MX Plan solution, go to our guide [Getting started with an MX Plan solution](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/emails/web_hosting_an_overview_of_ovh_email/).
>
> To familiarise yourself with the **OWA** interface, please refer to our guide on [Using an email account in the OWA interface](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/microsoft-collaborative-solutions/exchange_2016_outlook_web_app_user_guide/).

### RoundCube webmail main page <a name="general-interface"></a>

Once logged in to your email account, you have access to the main Roundcube interface, which consists of 3 zones:

- [**Left column**](#leftcolumn): Your email account tree, made up of folders and subfolders. The primary folder is the `Inbox`.

- [**Top window**](#topwindow): The list of emails in the folder selected in the left-hand column.

- [**Lower window**](#lowerwindow): The content of the email selected in the top window.

#### Folder management (left column) <a name="leftcolumn"></a>

In this zone, you will see the folders of your email account.

To manage folders more precisely, click on the cog at the bottom of the column, then `Manage folders`{.action}

![hosting](images/roundcube02.png){.thumbnail}

To create a folder, click the `+`{.action} button at the bottom of the `Folders` column.

To delete a folder, select it and click the cog at the bottom of the `Folders` column. Click on `Delete`{.action}. To clear the contents but keep the folder, click on `Clear`{.action}.

The check boxes at the folder level correspond to "subscriptions". The subscription determines whether the folder should be displayed at the webmail interface or the email software level while retaining the folder contents. The only purpose is to hide or display a folder on the email account.

> [!primary]
>
> Folders with a grey check box are special folders. You cannot delete them or remove them from subscriptions.

#### List of emails received/sent (top window) <a name="topwindow"></a>

This window displays the contents of the selected folder in the left column. 

##### **Display type**

This window can be customised by clicking on the cogwheel icon in the top left-hand corner of the window.

![hosting](images/roundcube03.png){.thumbnail}

You can set the following:

- **Layout**: Allows you to determine the layout of the management windows for an email account.
- **List columns**: Allows you to add columns to display (email priorities, etc.).
- **Sorting column**: Allows you to choose the column by which messages are sorted.
- **Sorting order**: Allows you to choose the ascending or descending sort order, depending on the sorting column.

##### **Actions on a selected email**

When an email is selected, you can choose an action it. Here are the possible actions:

- `Reply`{.action}: Reply directly to the sender.
- `Reply all`{.action}: Reply directly to all recipients listed in the To and Copy fields.
- `Forward`{.action}: Forward the selected email to one or more recipients.
- `Delete`{.action}: Move the selected email into the “Trash”.
- `Spam`{.action}: Place the selected email directly in the Junk folder, labelling it as **Spam**.
- `Mark`{.action}: Determine the status of an email manually.
- `More`{.action} 
    - `Print this message`{.action}.
    - `Download (.eml)`{.action}: Retrieve the header and the content of the email as a file.

> [!primary]
>
> If one of your contacts requests that an acknowledgement be sent back when you read their email, you will get the following message: `The sender of this message has asked to be notified when you read this message. Do you want to notify the sender?`.
> 

##### **Search for an email**

A search tool is available in the upper right corner of the interface.

Click the arrow to the right of the magnifying glass to display the search filters.

### Configuring RoundCube interface preferences

The following sections in this guide correspond to the tabs that make up the `Preferences`{.action} section of the RoundCube `Settings`{.action}. Their description is not exhaustive.

![hosting](images/roundcube06.png){.thumbnail}

#### User Interface

Set here the `Language` of the Roundcube interface as well as the `Time zone`, the `Time format` and the `Date format`.

The `Pretty Dates` option allows you to display the received/sent date with relative terms such as `Today`, `Yesterday`, etc.<br>
**For example**: it's **19/05/2022**, an email sent/received on **17/05/2022** at **17:38** will be displayed **Tue 17:38**, as the email corresponds to the previous Tuesday.

The `Show next entry in the list after deletion or move` check box means that after a delete or move action on an email, the item in the lower row will then always be selected, regardless of the sort order. 

#### Mailbox View

Set here the usability to view and act on emails. The `Layout` option allows you to arrange the 3 windows described in the [RoundCube webmail main interface section](#topwindow) .

#### Displaying Messages

Define how emails are displayed.<br>
We recommend that you tick the `Display HTML` box, to ensure that emails formatted by the sender are displayed correctly.<br>
It is also advisable to keep the `Allow remote resources (images, styles)` option on `never`. This avoids loading elements of an email that seems malicious.

#### Composing Messages

Set the default shape when writing an email or reply.<br>
It is recommended to pass the `Compose HTML messages` option on `always`, to benefit by default from HTML editing tools and not to alter an HTML signature.

#### Contacts

Customise the arrangement of information in your address book here.

#### Special Folders

RoundCube has 4 special folders: `Drafts`, `Sent`, `Spam`, `Deleted Items`.

We do not recommend changing them, but you can assign the behaviour of a special folder to another folder created later, using the drop-down menus.<br>
**For example**, you can assign the `Drafts` behaviour to another folder that you created. The emails that will be saved there will be considered drafts until they are actually sent.

#### Server Settings

In this tab, you can optimise the space occupied by an email account. The option `Clear "Deleted Items" on logout` prevents the messages that have been deleted from accumulating in this folder. The option `Permanently delete messages in the spam folder` will automatically delete all emails marked as spam.

> [!warning]
> 
> It is not recommended to enable the `Permanently delete messages in the spam folder` option, in the event that false positives (emails falsely declared as "SPAM") are marked as SPAM for the receiving server. When emails are placed in the `Spam` folder, it is still possible to check for legitimate messages.

### Managing identities and their signatures <a name="identity"></a>

In RoundCube, click `Settings`{.action} in the top bar, then `Identities`{.action} in the left column. "Identity" allows you to customise information sent to recipients such as the display name or a signature.

![hosting](images/roundcube07.png){.thumbnail}

#### Set attributes for an identity 

- **Display Name**: This name will appear in the “sender” section of the recipient.
- **Email**: This will be displayed as the address from which the email is sent.
- **Company**: A field for a company name, association, or another entity.
- **Reply-To**: Assign a reply email address different from the sender.
- **Bcc**: Send a blind copy to an email address.
- **Set default**: If there are multiple identities (signatures), assign this one by default.
- **Signature**: Customise the footer of your emails (surname, first name, job title, sentences, images, etc.).
- **HTML signature**: Activates the HTML format on the signature. 

> [!alert]
> 
> Filling in the **Email** box with an email address different from the one you are logged in to is considered to be *spoofing*. The IP address used for sending may be banned and/or considered "SPAM" by your recipients. 

#### Add a signature

By default, the `Signature` box is set to plain text. This format does not allow advanced editing or inserting an image into your signature. For advanced editing options for a signature, it is recommended that you enable HTML mode by clicking **HTML Signature**  under the text frame.

> [!warning]
> 
> If the signature is in HTML format, it will be necessary to switch to HTML mode for writing an email. You can enable this option by default for each email editing session, in the `Settings`{.action} section of the RoundCube interface.
> 
> Click `Preferences`{.action} in the left-hand column, then click `Composing Messages`{.action}. At **Compose HTML messages**, select `Always`.
>

To insert an image into a signature, the image must be hosted on a server (OVHcloud hosting or another).<br>
**Uploading an image from your device will not display it.**

Click the `< >`{.action} button in the HTML toolbar, then insert the following code, replacing `your-image-url` with the URL of the image, and `text-if-image-is-not-displayed` with text that replaces the image if it cannot be displayed.

```bash
<img src="your-image-url" border="0" alt="text-if-image-is-not-displayed" />
```

### Contact book

Click `Contacts`{.action} in the top bar to access the contact book. It is divided into **3 columns**:

- **Groups**: In the address book, you can create groups to classify contacts.
- **Contacts**: View the contacts for the selected address book or group.
- **Contact Properties** or **Add Contact**: This window appears when a contact is selected or is being created. You can read or edit contact information.

![hosting](images/roundcube09.png){.thumbnail}

#### Groups <a name="group"></a>

Groups are subcategories of the address book. They can be used to classify contacts into subsets. For example, it is easier to find a contact in a group you have created than in your entire address book. This also allows you to send an email by adding a group as a recipient, instead of adding the group contacts individually.

To create a group, click the `+`{.action} button at the bottom of the `Groups` column. Set the group name and click `Save`{.action} to validate.

![hosting](images/roundcube10.png){.thumbnail}

To assign a contact to a group, select a contact in the `Contacts` column. In the window that appears, click on the `Groups`{.action} tab. Select the group you want to assign to the contact.

#### Contacts <a name="contacts"></a>

In the `Groups` column, select the address book or one of the groups.

> [!primary]
> 
> When you create a contact from a selected group, the contact will be automatically added to the group.

Click the `+`{.action} button at the bottom of the `Contacts` column to create a contact.

![hosting](images/roundcube11.png){.thumbnail}

Then fill in the contact information.

> [!primary]
> You can add additional fields via the `Add Field...`{.action} drop-down menu, located under the `First name` and `Address` sections.

#### Import Contacts

In the `Contacts`{.action} window in the top bar, click `Import`{.action} to open the import window.

- `Import from file`: Select a CSV or vCard file on your computer. Contacts within a CSV file must be separated by commas. The file should not be larger than 20 MB.
- `Import group assignments`: If the contacts in your file are sorted by groups, you can enable this option to import this organisation. If you leave this option on `None`, no groups are assigned to the contacts.
- `Replace the entire address book`: If you have already configured a contact book, we recommend exporting it before ticking this option, or ensuring that you want to replace it permanently.

![hosting](images/roundcube-import-contact.png){.thumbnail}

#### Export RoundCube Contacts

In the `Contacts`{.action} window in the top bar, click the down arrow to the right of the `Export`{.action} button.

You can choose between:

- `Export all`{.action}: All contacts will be exported to a **.vcf** file.
- `Export selected`{.action}: Export only the items you have selected in the `Contacts`{.action} column.

![hosting](images/roundcube-export-contact.png){.thumbnail}

### Responses (templates) <a name="responses"></a>

This feature allows you to create response templates for composing an email.

In RoundCube, click `Settings`{.action} in the top bar, then `Responses`{.action} in the left column.

To add a response, click the `+`{.action} button at the bottom of the `Replies` column.

![hosting](images/roundcube12.png){.thumbnail}

> [!primary]
> 
> `Responses` are written in plain text format.

### Writing an email

From the `Email`{.action} tab in the top bar, click `Write`{.action}.

In the email editing window, you will see the following fields: 

- **From**: Choose an [identity](#identity) to define the sender.
- **To+**: Add recipients and/or a recipient [group](#group).

> [!primary]
> 
> The "**To**" field must not exceed 100 recipients, this includes contacts in a [group](#group).

- **Add Cc+**: Add single copy recipients.
- **Add Bcc+**: Add blind copy recipients. Other recipients of the email will not see addresses in BCC.
- **Add Followup-To**: Forward the email to recipients.
