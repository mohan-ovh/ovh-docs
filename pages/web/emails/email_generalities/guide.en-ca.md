## Objective

If you have just purchased an MX Plan solution, you can have email addresses, which can be used to send and receive messages from any device. 

**Find out how to get started with an MX Plan solution.**

## Requirements

- an MX plan solution, available via a [Web Hosting plan]({ovh_www}/web-hosting/){.external}, [the free Start10M Hosting plan]({ovh_www}/domains/start10m_hosting_offer.xmll){.external} or an MX Plan solution ordered separately
- access to the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}

## Instructions

Once the MX Plan solution is created and available, you can manage it from the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}. Depending on its activation date or if [it has been migrated recently]({ovh_www}/mxplan-migration/){.external}, you may have the old or new version of the solution. You will need to check this before you proceed any further. 

To do this, log in to the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, and open the `Web`{.action} section. Click `Emails`{.action} in the services bar on the left-hand side, then choose the name of the plan concerned. Continue with the next steps, depending on which version you own.
