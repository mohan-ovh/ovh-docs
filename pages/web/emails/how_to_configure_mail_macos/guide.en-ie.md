## Instructions

There are two ways of adding your email address to the Mail app:

- **Using our Apple Devices tool:** Click on the following link and follow the configuration steps: <https://autodiscover.mail.ovh.net/AppleDevices/>

- **Using the Mail app configuration assistant:** Launch the Mail app on your device.

From this point onwards, this guide will only cover configuration using the Mail app.

### Step 1: Add the account

Once you have launched the Mail app on your device, you can add an account in two different ways:

- **When you open the app for the first time:** A window will appear, asking you to select a service provider for your Mail account. Select `Other Mail account`{.action}, then continue.

- **If you have already added an account:** Click `Mail`{.action} at the top of your screen, then `Add account`{.action}. Select `Other Mail account`{.action}, then continue.

Enter your account information:

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Name|Enter the sender name that you wish to be displayed when sending emails from this address.|
|Email address|Enter your full email address.|
|Password|Enter your email address' password.|

Click on the `Log in`{.action} button. A message will appear, prompting you to continue. You should then enter the following information:

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Account type|We recommend using **IMAP** (selected by default). You can also select **POP** (in which your emails will be stored locally, on your Mail app) in the drop-down menu.|
|Incoming server|Enter the following server: ssl0.ovh.net.|
|Outgoing server|Enter the following server: ssl0.ovh.net.|

Click again on the `Log in`{.action} button. If all the information you have entered is correct, you will be able to log in to your account straight away.

When you are asked to select the apps you want to use with your account, ensure that `Mail`{.action} is ticked, so the application will work correctly with your email address. You should then click `Done`{.action}.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email.

If you need to enter any settings manually in your account preferences, the technical settings you will need to use with our MX Plan solution are listed below:

- **for IMAP configuration**

|Server type|Server name|SSL|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|993|
|Outgoing|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|465| 

- **for POP configuration**

|Server type|Server name|SSL|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|995|
|Outgoing|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|465|

### Step 2: Start using your email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it to send and receive emails straight away!

OVH also has a web application you can use to access your email account via your browser. You can access the application at the following address, using your email credentials: <https://www.ovh.ie/mail/>.
