With the email accounts included in your [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/web-hosting/), you can send and receive your emails using a device and client of your choice. To access an account from anywhere via web browser, OVHcloud provides an online email client called Outlook Web Application (OWA). Our [webmail login page]https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/mail) is the single point of access to the respective OWA for all active email accounts on MX Plan and [Hosted Exchange](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ca/emails/hosted-exchange/).

Please refer to [this guide](../../microsoft-collaborative-solutions/exchange_2016_outlook_web_app_user_guide/) to learn about the general OWA functionalities.
