With the email accounts included in your [OVHcloud Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/asia/web-hosting/), you can send and receive your emails using a device and client of your choice. To access an account from anywhere via web browser, OVHcloud provides an online email client called Outlook Web Application (OWA). Our [webmail login page](https://www.ovh.com/asia/mail) is the single point of access to the respective OWA for all active email accounts.

Please refer to [this guide](/pages/web/microsoft-collaborative-solutions/creating-inbox-rules-in-owa) to learn about creating inbox rules.
