To do this, log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg){.external}, and open the `Web Cloud`{.action} section.

There are two ways of changing the password for an email address. You can proceed according to which method you want to use.

- [Change the password via OWA webmail](./#change-the-password-via-owa-webmail). You will need to have your current password for this method. 
- [Change the password via the OVHcloud Control Panel](./#change-the-password-via-the-ovhcloud-control-panel). You will not need your current password for this method.

#### Change the password via OWA webmail.

Firstly, go to the [webmail login](https://www.ovh.com/sg/mail/){.external} page. Enter your full email address and password, then click the `Login`{.action} button.

#### Change the password via the OVHcloud Control Panel.

To start with, go to the `Email accounts`{.action} tab. The table that appears will contain all of the email addresses you have created as part of your MX Plan solution. Next, click the `...`{.action} button to the right of the email address you want to change the password for, then click `Modify`{.action}.

![email](images/mxplan-password-new-step6.png){.thumbnail}

In the window that opens, enter a new password and confirm it. For security reasons, we recommend not using the same password twice, choosing one that does not contain any personal information (e.g. your surname, first name, and date of birth), and we also recommend renewing it regularly.

Once you have done this, click the `Next`{.action} button, then click `Confirm`{.action}. The password change will take effect after a few minutes.

Once you have changed your password, you can access your email address. There are two ways you can do this:

- **Using webmail:** go to the [webmail login](https://www.ovh.com/sg/mail/){.external} page, then enter your email address and new password. If you have just changed your password and the login fails, wait a few moments, then try to sign in again. To find out how to use your email address via OWA webmail, use our guide guide on [Using an email address via Outlook Web Access (OWA) webmail](../using-owa){.external}.

- **Using compatible email software:** you will need to enter the new password on all of the devices your email address is linked to. To do this, a window may appear automatically, prompting you to enter your password. Otherwise, you can [refer to our configuration guides](../) or contact the publisher of the software or application you are using, as the process may be specific to the tool.

### MX Plan legacy version <a name="mx-legacy"></a>

If you are using the legacy version of the MX Plan solution, this is what you should see. If not, please double-check that you are following the right set of instructions [by referring to the information above](./#instructions).

To change the password for an email address, go to the `Email`{.action} tab. The table that appears will contain all of the email addresses created as part of your MX Plan solution.
