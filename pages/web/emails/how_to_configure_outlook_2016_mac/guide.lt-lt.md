## Instructions

### Step 1: Add the account

Once you have launched Outlook on your device, you can add an account in two different ways:

- **When you start the application for the first time**: A setup wizard will appear and prompt you to enter your email address.

- **If you have already added an account:** Click `Tools`{.action} in the menu bar at the top of your screen, then `Accounts`{.action}. In the window that pops up, click on `+`{.action} then on `New account`{.action}.

Enter your email address, then click `Continue`{.action}. For the provider, click on `IMAP/POP`{.action}, then enter the information requested.

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Account type|We recommend using **IMAP** (selected by default). You can also select **POP** (emails stored locally on your Mail app) in the drop-down menu.|
|Mail address|Enter a name that will distinguish this account from any other accounts added in your Outlook app.|
|Username|Enter your full email address.|
|Password|Enter the password for your email address.|
|Incoming server|Enter the server “ssl0.ovh.net”. Leave the **Use SSL to connect** box ticked.|
|Incoming port|Enter port 993.|
|Outgoing server|Enter the server “ssl0.ovh.net”. Leave the **Use SSL to connect** box ticked.|
|Outgoing port|Enter port 465.|

Once you have entered this information, click `Next`{.action}. If the information is correct, Outlook will successfully connect to the account.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email.

If you need to enter any settings manually in your account preferences, the technical settings you will need to use with our MX Plan solution are listed below:

- **IMAP configuration**

|Server type|Server name|SSL|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|993|
|Outgoing|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|465|

- **POP configuration**

|Server type|Server name|SSL|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|995|
|Outgoing|ssl0.ovh.net|Yes|465|

### Step 2: Use the email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it! You can now send and receive messages.

OVH also offers a web application that you can use to consult your email from a web browser. You can access this application at <https://www.ovh.lt/mail/>. Just log in using your email login details.
