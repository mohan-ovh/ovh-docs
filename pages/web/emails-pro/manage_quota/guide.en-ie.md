## Objective

Every OVHcloud email account has a dedicated storage space. By managing your storage space properly, you can avoid it becoming full, also known as “overquota”. By default, the emails you receive and send are stored on the server of your email account. You can also store your emails locally on your computer using an email client (Outlook, macOS Mail, Thunderbird, etc.).

**This guide explains how to manage and optimise the storage space of email accounts.**

## Requirements

- A preconfigured OVHcloud email solution, such as [**Hosted Exchange**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/emails/hosted-exchange/), [**Email Pro**](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/emails/email-pro/)) or **MX Plan** (available with a [web hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/web-hosting/), a [free Start 10M hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/domains/free-web-hosting/), or ordered separately)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie)
- Login credentials for the email account concerned

> - Regarding the free Start 10M hosting solution, you will need to activate it beforehand in order to create an email account. You can do this from your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie) by going to the domain name concerned.
> - For [web hosting plans](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/web-hosting/), you will need to activate your MX Plan before continuing with this guide. To do this, please refer to our guide on [Activating the email addresses included in your web hosting plan](https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/hosting/activate-email-web-hosting/).
