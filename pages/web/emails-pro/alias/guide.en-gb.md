## Objective

By creating an alias for your email address, you can give out a "concealment" address to your contacts, without having to disclose your personal email address to the sender. One email account can have multiple aliases.

For example, your email address is **john.smith@mydomain.ovh** and you create an alias named **anonymous@mydomain.ovh**. You can then provide the address **anonymous@mydomain.ovh** to your contacts and receive your emails on **john.smith@mydomain.ovh** without the sender having knowledge of **john.smith@mydomain.ovh**.

**This guide explains how to add an alias address to an email account in the OVHcloud Control Panel.**
