## Instructions

### Step 1: Add the account

Once you have launched Outlook on your device, you can add an account in two different ways:

- **When you start the application for the first time.** A setup wizard will appear and prompt you to enter your email address.

- **If you have already added an account.** Click `Tools`{.action} in the menu bar at the top of your screen, then `Accounts`{.action}. In the window that pops up, click `+`{.action}, then `New account`{.action}.

Enter your email address, then click `Continue`{.action}. For the provider, click on `IMAP/POP`{.action}, then enter the information requested.

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Account type|Leave **IMAP** (selected by default).|
|Mail address|Enter a name that will distinguish this account from any other accounts added in your Outlook app.|
|Username|Enter your full email address.|
|Password|Enter the password for your email address.|
|Incoming server|Enter the server “pro1.mail.ovh.net”. Leave the "Use SSL to connect" box ticked.|
|Incoming port|Enter port 993.|
|Outgoing server|Enter the server “pro1.mail.ovh.net”. Leave the "Use SSL to connect" box ticked.|
|Outgoing port|Enter port 587.|

Once you have entered this information, click `Next`{.action}. If the information is correct, Outlook will successfully connect to the account.

To check that the account has been configured correctly, you can send a test email.
