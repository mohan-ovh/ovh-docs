## Instructions

### Step 1: Add the account

> [!primary]
>
> In this guide, we will use as the server name: pro**X**.mail.ovh.net. You will need to replace the "X" with the actual number indicating the appropriate server for your Email Pro service.
> 
> You can find this information in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager), in the `Web`{.action} section, if you select `Professional Email`{.action} in the left-hand column. The server name is displayed in the **Connection** box in the `General Information`{.action} tab.
> 

Once you have launched the Outlook app on your device, you can add an account in two different ways:

- **When you start the application for the first time**: A setup wizard will appear and prompt you to enter your email address.

- **If you have already added an account:** Click `File`{.action} in the menu bar at the top of your screen, then `Add account`{.action}.

Enter your email address, then click `Advanced options`{.action}. Tick the box that appears next to `Let me set up my account manually`{.action}, then click `Connection`{.action}. Select **IMAP** from the list of account types.

Then fill in the information requested:

- **For incoming mail:**

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Server|Enter “pro**X**.mail.ovh.net”.|
|Port|Enter port “993”.|
|Encryption method|Select “SSL/TLS”.|
|Requiring authentication|Do not tick the “Require secure password authentication (SPA) on connection” box.|

- **For outgoing mail:**

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Server|Enter “pro**X**.mail.ovh.net”.|
|Port|Enter port “587”.|
|Encryption method|Select “STARTTLS”.|
|Requiring authentication|Do not tick the “Require secure password authentication (SPA) on connection” box.|

Once you have entered this information, click `Next`{.action} and enter your email address’ **password**. If all the information you have entered is correct, you will be able to log in to your account straight away.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email.

|Server type|Server name|Encryption method|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|pro**X**.mail.ovh.net|SSL/TLS|993|
|Outgoing|pro**X**.mail.ovh.net|STARTTLS|587|
