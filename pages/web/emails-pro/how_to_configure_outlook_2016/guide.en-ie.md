## Instructions

### Step 1: Add the account

Once you have launched the Outlook app on your device, you can add an account in two different ways:

- **When you start the application for the first time**: A setup wizard will appear and prompt you to enter your email address.

- **If you have already added an account:** Click `File`{.action} in the menu bar at the top of your screen, then `Add account`{.action}.

Then fill in the information requested:

- **For incoming mail:**

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Server|Enter the server “pro1.mail.ovh.net”.|
|Port|Enter port “993”.|
|Encryption method|Select “SSL/TLS”.|
|Requiring authentication|Do not tick the “Require secure password authentication (SPA) on connection” box.|

- **For outgoing mail:**

|Information|Description|
|---|---|
|Server|Enter the server “pro1.mail.ovh.net”.|
|Port|Enter port “587”.|
|Encryption method|Select “STARTTLS”.|
|Requiring authentication|Do not tick the “Require secure password authentication (SPA) on connection” box.|

Once you have entered this information, click `Next`{.action} and enter your email address’ **password**. If all the information you have entered is correct, you will be able to log in to your account straight away.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email.
