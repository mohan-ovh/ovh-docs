## Instructions

There are two ways of adding your email address to the Mail app:

From this point onwards, this guide will only cover email configuration using your device.

### Step 1: Add the account

On your device’s homepage, go to `Settings`{.action}. There are two ways of adding an account, depending on the iOS version you are using:

- **For iOS 7, 8, 9 and 10:** Go to `Mail, Contacts, Calendar`{.action}, then `Add account`{.action}. Choose `Other`{.action}, then `Add a Mail account`{.action}.

- **For iOS 11:** Go to `Accounts and passwords`{.action}, then `Add account`{.action}. Choose `Other`{.action}, then `Add a Mail account`{.action}.

When you are asked to select the apps you want to use with your account, ensure that `Mail`{.action} is ticked, so the application will work correctly with your email address. You should then tap `Save`{.action}.

To check that the account has been correctly configured, you can send a test email.

If you need to enter any settings manually in your account preferences, the technical settings you will need to use with our Email Pro solution are listed below:

|Server type|Server name|SSL|Port|
|---|---|---|---|
|Incoming|pro1.mail.ovh.net|Yes|993|
|Outgoing|pro1.mail.ovh.net|Yes|587|

### Step 2: Use the email address

Once you have configured your email address, you can start using it to send and receive emails straight away!
