## Objective

In your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au), you can increase the capacity of your [web hosting offers](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/) to have more compute resources, storage space, databases or email accounts. Additional features such as [mailing lists](/pages/web/emails/feature_mailing_list) (from the [Professional plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/professional-offer/)) or [Private SQL](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/options/private-sql/) (included with the offers of the [Performance range](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/performance-offer/)) will also become available with a subscription upgrade.

## Instructions

> [!warning]
>
> **Before** you make any changes to your current subscription, check to see if these questions apply to your situation:
>
> - [How do I get a temporary performance boost on my Performance hosting plan?](#boost)
> - [Will I waste the time remaining on my current hosting plan when I change plans?](#billing)
>

### Modifying your hosting plan <a name="modify"></a>

> [!warning]
> Subscription downgrading is not available for customers whose services are hosted in a data centre outside Europe.

Then select your new subscription and its duration. Confirm the corresponding contracts, then click `Send`{.action}.

### Special cases

#### Boost your Performance web hosting plan temporarily <a name="boost"></a>

With the [Boost option](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/options/boost/), available on our *Performance* plans, you can temporarily increase your hosting system’s CPU and RAM resources to absorb seasonal traffic spikes. If this increase is prolonged over time, you can also [switch to a higher-level Performance plan](#modify) to have these resources permanently.

> [!warning]
>
> When you choose to enable the Boost option, the option remains active and is billed **until you disable it**.

If the **Boost** option suits your needs, below are the instructions for **enabling** or **disabling** this option on your web hosting plan.

> [!tabs]
> **Enable the Boost option**
>>
>> In the `General information` section of your Web Hosting plan, click on the `...`{.action} button to the right of `Boost`, then `Boost my plan`{.action}.<br><br>
>> ![boost](images/enable_boost.png){.thumbnail}<br>
>>
> **Disable the Boost option**
>>
>> In the `More` tab of your web hosting plan, click `Boost my plan`{.action}.<br>
>> The Boost option usage table will appear, click `Disable boost plan`{.action}.<br><br>
>> ![boost](images/disable_boost.png){.thumbnail}<br>

#### Billing in case of a change of offer <a name="billing"></a>

When you upgrade your original plan to a higher plan, a *prorata temporis* calculation will be applied until the next renewal date for your original plan.
This calculation corresponds to the price difference between your initial solution and your new solution.

> **Example:**<br>
>
> You subscribed to a [Personal Hosting](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/personal-offer/) subscription on January 1, 2022.
>
> On October 31, 2022, you upgrade from this **Personal** plan to a [Professional plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-au/web-hosting/professional-offer/).<br>
>
> Therefore, the amount corresponding to the remaining duration on the **Personal** subscription (2 months, from November 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023) is automatically deducted from the cost of the new **Professional** subscription, until January 1, 2023. You will only pay the difference.
> From 1st January 2023, you will then be billed for your Professional subscription at its current price.

Please follow [these instructions](#modify) to change your plan.
