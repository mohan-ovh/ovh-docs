## Requirements

- An OVHcloud [Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/)
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Access the FTP user management interface

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB). Go to the `Web Cloud`{.action} section, click on `Hosting plans`{.action}, then select the service concerned. Click on the `FTP-SSH`{.action} tab.

A table will display the FTP users created on your Web Hosting plan. These users allow you to access your FTP storage space to put your website files online. When you set up your Web Hosting plan, a user account will be created automatically.

### Step 2: Modify the FTP user password

Depending on which OVHcloud [Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/web-hosting/) you have, there are two different paths for changing your FTP user password user via the `FTP-SSH`{.action} tab:

- **For Web Hosting plans that do not allow you to create a second FTP user** (Start 10M and Personal hosting): Click on the pencil icon in the `Password`{.action} column, enter the new password, then confirm the change by clicking on the green button.

- **For plans that allow you to create multiple FTP users** (Professional and Performance): Click on the three dots to the right of the concerned FTP user, then on `Change password`{.action}. Enter your new password in the window that pops up, enter it again and click on `Confirm`{.action}.

Choose the new password for your database. In both cases, they must meet the following conditions:

- Minimum 8 characters
- Maximum 30 characters
- At least one capital letter
- At least one lower-case letter
- At least one number
- Be composed only of numbers and letters

Then go to the `Ongoing Jobs`{.action} tab and refresh the page regularly. Your change will be effective within a few minutes.

### Step 3: Access your storage space

There are several ways you can log in to your hosting space to access the files:

- **FTP Explorer**: You can access this software via the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.co.uk/&ovhSubsidiary=GB). To use it, click on the `FTP Explorer`{.action} button in the `FTP-SSH`{.action} tab.

> [!warning]
>
> FTP Explorer is not available for Cloud Web solutions. You will need to use one of the following two methods.

- **FTP software**: You will need to install FTP-compatible software on your computer (for example, [FileZilla](/pages/web/hosting/ftp_filezilla_user_guide)).

- **SSH access** (only on Professional and Performance plans): Please read our guide on "[Accessing a web hosting plan via SSH](/pages/web/hosting/ssh_on_webhosting)" to use this connection protocol.
