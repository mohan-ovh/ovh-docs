### 2.5 Link your PrestaShop to your OVHcloud database

![PrestaShop installation step 6](images/Prestashop-install-db-config-6.png){.thumbnail}

Have your database login details ready (if necessary, see **Step 1.4** in the [manual installation of a CMS tutorial](/pages/web/hosting/cms_manual_installation)).

Enter the information requested for the database:

- *Database server address*: Enter the name of your database server, specified in the installation email and displayed in your OVHcloud Control Panel.

> [!primary]
> 
> - The server name of a database included with your web hosting plan usually has this format: `NameOfYourDatabase.mysql.db`.
>
> - The server name of a Web Cloud Databases database starts with your OVHcloud NIC handle and is in the following format: `OVHID(without-ovh)-XXX.eu.clouddb.ovh.net` where **"XXX"** is to be replaced by the reference of your Web Cloud Databases service.
>

- *Database name*: This name was defined when the database was created in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com.au/&ovhSubsidiary=au).

- *Database login*: It is identical to the database name if you are using a database included with your web hosting plan. For databases created on Web Cloud Databases, please refer to the information in **Step 1.4** in the [manual installation of a CMS tutorial](/pages/web/hosting/cms_manual_installation).

- *Database password*: You defined it yourself when you created your database. You may have modified it in the meantime.

- *Tables prefix*: If you are installing with a brand new database, enter your preferred prefix. If you are using a database that has already been used by another website, please refer to **Step 1.4** in the tutorial on [manually installing a CMS](/pages/web/hosting/cms_manual_installation) to avoid entering a table prefix that has already been used in your database.

- *Drop existing tables*: **Uncheck this box if you are already using your database with another website**.

>[!alert]
>
> If you leave the **Drop existing tables** check box ticked, it will delete all the tables already in your database.
>

Click `Test your database connection now!`{.action} to verify the entered settings:

![PrestaShop installation step 6-1](images/Prestashop-install-db-config-6-1.png){.thumbnail}

If the message "Your database is connected" appears, click `Next`{.action}. Otherwise, check the settings you entered until the connection is working. If required, please refer to **Step 1.4** in the tutorial on [manually installing a CMS](/pages/web/hosting/cms_manual_installation/).

#### 2.6 Complete the PrestaShop installation

The final step is a summary of the installation you have just carried out:
