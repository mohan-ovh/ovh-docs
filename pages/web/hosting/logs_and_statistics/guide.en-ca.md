### Visit statistics

The **OVHcloud Web Statistics** tool helps you to track and control the traffic of websites hosted on your Web Hosting plan, by visually compiling statistics of page visits and audience measurement.

The dashboard of OVHcloud Web Statistics is presented in 6 sections in the left-hand panel.

- Dashboard: visualises the website traffic on your Web Hosting plan.
- Browsers: shows a ranking of the most used internet browsers to view your sites.
- Geolocalization: groups site visitors according to their location.
- Requests: displays the ranking of the most visited pages on your sites.
- Robots: visualises the automated attempts to connect to your sites.
- Status: displays statistics of the failures and successes encountered, based on the HTTP codes returned.
- FAQ: opens the section dedicated to frequently asked questions.

The `Period selection` box allows you to select a specific time frame.

### Logs

You can view the raw logs of your site with a delay of about 5 minutes.

Different types of logs are available:

- **web**: Here you can find the various logs of your site visits, as well as the outgoing actions from your site. For example, this allows you to detect malicious access attempts.
- **ftp**: The different FTP connections will be stored in these logs.
- **error**: These logs contain the errors generated by your site.
- **cgi**: These logs collect the various calls to the cgi.bin scripts that were made.
- **out**: These are the external calls of your hosting.
- **ssh**: These logs indicate the different connections made with the SSH protocol.
- **cron**: The results of executing your [scheduled tasks](/pages/web/hosting/cron_tasks) are logged here.

### Hosting activity

In this section you can view your Web Hosting plan’s infrastructure activity as well as the resource usage.

Switch to the `General information`{.action} tab, then scroll to the bottom of the page.
