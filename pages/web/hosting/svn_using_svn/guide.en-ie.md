## Objective

SVN, which stands for "subversion," is a version management system. 

**This guide explains how to use SVN over an SSH connection on your Web Hosting plan.**

## Requirements

- a [Web Hosting plan](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-ie/web-hosting/) that allows an SSH connection (**from the Professional plan onwards**)
- access to your Web Hosting plan via SSH (see our guide on [accessing a Web Hosting plan via SSH](../web_hosting_ssh_on_web_hosting_packages/))

## Instructions

### Creating the repository

Once you have logged in via [SSH on your hosting](../web_hosting_ssh_on_web_hosting_packages/), first create the root directory of your SVN repositories, then the repository.

To do this, simply type these commands:

```bash
mkdir svn
```

```bash
svnadmin create svn/depot_test
```

You can then check that the directories have been created with the following command:

```bash
ls -la
```

You should see the directories as shown in the following image:

### Creating public/private keys

Before you continue, it is necessary to create a pair of SSH keys from the desktop you will use to connect to the SVN repository.

In order to create a key pair, please follow our guide on [Creating SSH keys](../../public-cloud/create-ssh-keys/). You can ignore the step regarding the import of your SSH key to the OVHcloud Control Panel.

### Adding the public key to the Web Hosting plan

Once you have obtained your key, add it in the ".ssh/authorised_keys2" file by typing the commands below:

```bash
mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
vi .ssh/authorized_keys2
```

The new file opens for editing. Insert the following line, followed by the previously created key. Make sure that the whole string is on the same line.

```bash
command="/usr/bin/svnserve --root=/homez.XXX/loginFTP/svn --tunnel --tunnel-user=john",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty
```

> [!primary]
>
> Replace "/home.XXX/loginFTP" and "john" with your SSH credentials.
> To find out the correct numbers to use inside "/home.XXX/loginFTP", type the command "pwd" at the command line.
>
> You can also find this information in our guide on [Accessing a Web Hosting plan via SSH](../web_hosting_ssh_on_web_hosting_packages/}.

You can retrieve the contents of the repository without directly logging in via SSH on the hosting.

> The same key must not be used for SVN and the SSH connection.

### Examples

#### On Linux

You can run a test from the computer connecting to the SVN repository by typing the following line:

```bash
svn checkout svn+ssh://loginFTP@clusterXXX/depot_test
```

#### On Windows with TortoiseSVN

- Download and install [TortoiseSVN](https://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html){.external}.
- Right-click the private key. An icon appears in the bottom right-hand corner, and the key is loaded into the authentication agent.
- Create a directory, right-click on it and select "SVN Checkout". 
- Enter `svn+ssh://loginFTP@xxplan.ovh.net/depot_test` in the “URL of repository” field and click `OK`.

Please also read the documentation for Subversion: [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/index.html](http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/index.html){.external}

### Specific cases

#### Creating multiple accounts

First, you need to create SSH key pairs for each user. Then add the public key to the hosting as explained above:

```bash
command="/usr/bin/svnserve --root=/home.XXX/loginFTP/svn --tunnel --tunnel-user=username",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty
```

Replace "username" with your respective identifiers and repeat the command to add multiple users.

Note that it is also possible to grant a read-only access by adding this parameter:

```bash
--read-only.
```

#### Checking locally on the server

If you want to perform a local check, the examples provided will not work. You will need to use the command like this:

```bash
svn+ssh://login@ftp.name-of-site.tld/home.XXX/login/svn/depot_test
```
