## Objective

The **Fault Tolerance** (FT) functionality of VMware's vSphere allows to protect a virtual machine from hardware failures by cloning the VM on two separate hosts.

## Instructions

To activate **Fault Tolerance**, right-click on a VM, then click `Fault Tolerance` and `Turn On Fault Tolerance`.
