## Objective

The [Public Cloud](https://www.ovh.lt/public-cloud/instances/){.external} lets you create instances (i.e. virtual servers) quickly and easily, in just a few clicks.

**This guide will show you how to create an instance in your Public Cloud account.**

## Requirements

* access to the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}
* a [Public Cloud](https://www.ovh.lt/public-cloud/instances/){.external} project created in your OVH account
* an SSH key created in your OVH customer account

## Intructions

### Configure the instance

After clicking the `Add a server`{.action} button, the configuration settings will appear as shown below.

![configure an instance](images/pci-instance-configuration-01.png){.thumbnail}

These settings allow you to configure:

* the datacentre and region where the instance will be hosted
* the server's operating system
* the server model
* an SSH key for security (not needed for Windows servers)
* several advanced options

> [!primary]
>
Please note that for Windows servers, authentication is password based, so SSH keys are not used at all.

When you have configured the options you want, decide whether you want the instance to be billed hourly or monthly and toggle the billing switch accordingly.

Finally, click the `Launch now`{.action} button to create the instance.

Your instance will now be created. It may take a few minutes to finalise.

Once the instance has been created, your login information will be displayed, which you can copy to your computer's clipboard by clicking the copy icon.

The newly-created instance will now be visible in your account.

When you create an instance and choose to pay monthly, you must keep this instance for at least until the end of the current month.
