## Instructions

### Create an OpenStack user account

First of all, to access the Horizon interface, you need to create an OpenStack user account. To do this, log in to your Control Panel and go to the `Public Cloud`{.action} section in the top-left corner of the page. Then, on the following screen, click the `arrow button`{.action} next to your project name in the top-left corner of the screen.

The user description is not the username for the user. It is just a descriptive term to help you remember what kind of user it is. The next screen will allow you to grant user permissions. For each permissions box you check, the user will get the corresponding privileges as seen in the table below:

Click the `Confirm`{.action} button when you are finished and you will see the following screen:

Be sure to save your password now as this is the only time you will be able to recover it. However, if you lose it you can always create a new one by clicking the ellipses (...) on the following menu and selecting `Generate a password:`{.action}

Once your user has been created, you can use these credentials to log into the Horizon interface using the `Horizon button`{.action} on the left-hand sidebar.

### Log in to OpenStack Horizon

To open the menu, click on the three-dot icon at the end of the line (`...`{.action}). Next, click the `Open OpenStack Horizon`{.action} link. The [Horizon](https://horizon.cloud.ovh.net/auth/login/){.external} login page will then appear. To log in, enter your `User Name` and your password.
