## Objective

The vSphere interface is accessible by default over the Internet. For infrastructures that can be managed through the vRack private network, vSphere access can be switched over to the vRack through the private gateway.

**This guide explains how to enable private gateway on your Hosted Private Cloud infrastructure through the OVHcloud API.**

> [!warning]
>
> Activating the private gateway blocks access from the Internet, so it is important to make sure you can access the vRack.
>

## Requirements

* An [OVHcloud Private Cloud](https://www.ovh.co.uk/private-cloud/){.external} solution
* Access to the vSphere interface
* Being connected to [OVHcloud API](https://api.ovh.com/console){.external}.
* Creating [OVHcloud API credentials](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/customer/first-steps-with-ovh-api/){.external}.

## Instructions

### Architecture

* The private gateway is a virtual machine (VM) that will be deployed on the infrastructure and connected to the vRack.
* The private gateway does not have a route, so only the user of the same subnet can reach the gateway. The connection from another network must be a source-nat.

> [!warning]
>
> The TLS certificate remains the same (pcc-X-X-X-X-X.ovh.com).
>

### Prerequisites

* Create a Portgroup on the vRack to connect the private gateway. It must be under the right datacenter.
* Have added the private gateway network to [restrictions per source IP](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/private-cloud/control-panel-ovh-private-cloud/).
* Add a entry in file /etc/hosts or C:\Windows\system32\etc\hosts for pcc-X-X-X-X.ovh.com with the private IP

### Enable the Private Gateway

Before starting, get the following necessary information:
- **serviceName** : the Hosted Private Cloud name(syntaxe pcc-X-X-X-X)
- **datacenterId** : the datacenter ID
- **ip** & **netmask** : the IP address and netmask for the private gateway
- **portgroup** : the PortGroup name for vRack connexion.

To be used in the following API calls.

Start activation with:

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/datacenter/{datacenterId}/privateGateway/enable
>

The call creates a task that will deploy the virtual machine and make the network configuration.

### Disable the Private Gateway

Before starting, get the following necessary information:
- **serviceName** : the Hosted Private Cloud name(syntaxe pcc-X-X-X-X)
- **datacenterId** : the datacenter ID

> [!warning]
>
> Turning off the private gateway restores access from the Internet, so it is important to ensure that you have set up the IP filtering you want.
>

Start deactivation with:

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /dedicatedCloud/{serviceName}/datacenter/{datacenterId}/privateGateway/disable
