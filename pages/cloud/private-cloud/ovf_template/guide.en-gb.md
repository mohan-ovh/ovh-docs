## Objective

OVH offers Windows and SQL Server templates (in OVF format) that you can deploy directly from your vSphere Thick Client (version 5.5 and 6.0) or from the Web Client (Flash and HTML 5 on version 6.5).

**This guide will show you where you can find the source files, and how to deploy them.**

## Requirements

- access to the Web Client or the Thick Client, depending on the version you use
- [active Windows licences](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/private-cloud/control-panel-ovh-private-cloud/#windows-licence){.external} (activate via the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, in the `Windows licence`{.action} tab for the datacentre)

### Find the URL of the OVF template

In your web browser, go to the Private Cloud page on the OVH website, and click on `OVH Templates`{.action}.

In the `OVH Templates` page that pops up, you can view the details of the Windows and SQL templates available. 

Select the template you need. A window will open containing links that you can use to deploy the template, depending on which version of vSphere you use.

This page lists all of the templateâ€™s details, including its default password. For security reasons, it is important that you change your password as soon as you log in for the first time:

Select the datastore in which the virtual machine will be located, and the format of the disk:

When you click on `Finish`{.action}, a task is created, and you can use it to track the progress of the deployment:
