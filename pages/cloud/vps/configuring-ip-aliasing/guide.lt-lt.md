## Objective

IP aliasing is a special network configuration for your OVH servers, which allows you to associate multiple IP addresses with a single network interface.

**This guide explains how to add failover IPs to your VPS configuration.**

## Requirements

* a [Virtual Private Server](https://www.ovh.lt/vps/){.external}
* a failover IP address or a failover IP block (RIPE)
* administrative (root) access to the server via SSH

## Instructions

### Debian 9

#### Step 1: Disable automatic network configuration

First, open the following file, as shown below:

```sh
# nano /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
```
Next, edit the file with the configuration shown below. This will prevent changes from being made to your network configuration automatically.

```sh
network: {config: disabled}
```

### Step 2: Edit the network configuration file

Next, open the network configuration file for editing with the following command:

```sh
# nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init.cfg
```
Then edit the file with the following configuration:

> [!primary]
>
Note that then names of the network interfaces in our example may differ from your own. Please substitute your own interfaces.
>

```sh
auto ens3
iface ens3 inet dhcp

auto ens3:0
iface ens3:0 inet static
address FailoverIP 0
netmask 255.255.255.255

auto ens3:1
iface ens3:1 inet static
address FailoverIP 1
netmask 255.255.255.255
```

### Ubuntu 18.04

Each failover IP address will need its own line within this file. The configuration file for your failover IP addresses should be called `50-cloud-init.yaml`.

#### Step 1: Create the configuration file

Connect to your server via SSH and run the following command:

```sh
# nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
```

Next, edit the file with the content below:

```sh
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        your_network_interface:
            dhcp4: true
            match:
                macaddress: fa:xx:xx:xx:xx:63
            set-name: your_network_interface
            addresses:
            - your_failover_ip/32
```

Finally, save and close the file.

Repeat this procedure for each failover IP address.
