OVH managed databases services are based on several major releases of different DataBase Management System (DBMS) products. Those DBMS are third-party softwares, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. Earlier versions of the managed databases services can reach their End-Of-Sale (EOS) or End-Of-Life (EOL), mainly because of the life cycle of the underlying DBMS. This policy is provided to help customers to understand the life cycle of the OVH managed databases products, to anticipate and prepare the transition to newest versions.

## Products coverage

The products covered by this EOL policy are Enterprise Cloud Databases. ([See announcements](../postgresql-eos-eol/)).



## General policy guidelines and definitions

![timeline](images/ovh.eol.policy.timeline.png)

## End-of-Life (EOL) announcement

This is the publication of the End-of-Sale and the End-of-Support schedule.
As a general rule, OVH will provide 90 days notice of the affected product's EOL schedule.
This notice will appear on the docs.ovh.com website

## End-Of-Sale (EOS)

The last date to order the product through OVH point-of-sale mechanisms. The product is no longer for sale.
As said previously, this date is at least 90 days later than the EOL announcement date.

## End-Of-Support

The last date to receive applicable service and support for the product as entitled by active service contracts.
After this date, all support services for the product are unavailable, and the product becomes obsolete.
As a general rule, this date is at least 6 months later than the EOL announcement date.

## Obsolescence period

This is the period right after the End-Of-Support date.

When an OVH managed databases service is obsolete, it can faces two cases listed below.
As there can be an impact on your services, an email notice will be sent at least one month before this Obsolescence period.

**Service major upgrade**

We keep your service up and running, and we upgrade the software to a newest major version.
Because of the underlying DBMS products, this kind of upgrade can break existing behaviours. This is why we advise customers to prepare the transition to newest versions long before reaching the End-Of-Support.

**Service discontinuation**

Instead of upgrading the service to the next available major version, we can decide to discontinue the service, for various reasons, such as:

- The upgrade is discouraged by the software editor of the underlying DBMS,

- The DBMS had been discontinued itself,

- ...

The discontinuation can be performed in two ways, depending on the cases:
- We disable the service renewal. In this case, the service will be suspended at the end of your engagement.

- We suspend the service and re-credit over-payment.
