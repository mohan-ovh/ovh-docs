## Objective

Nutanix clusters are scalable. You can add nodes to an existing cluster.

**This guide will show you how to add a node and ensure it works properly.**

> [!warning]
> OVHcloud provides services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and management. You are therefore responsible for ensuring they function correctly.
>
> This guide is designed to assist you in common tasks as much as possible. Nevertheless, we recommend that you contact a [specialist service provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en/directory/) if you have difficulties or doubts concerning the administration, usage or implementation of services on a server.

## Requirements

- A Nutanix cluster in your OVHcloud account
- Access to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.pl/&ovhSubsidiary=pl)
- You must be connected to the cluster via Prism Central
- A ready-to-configure physical server added to the OVHcloud Control Panel

## Technical information

The **Hosted Private Cloud solution powered by Nutanix** enables you to have between 3 and 18 nodes on the same cluster.

It is possible to add several nodes when expanding the cluster.

The nodes to be added must have the same version of **AOS** as the existing cluster.

## Instructions

### Add a node to a Nutanix cluster.

Connect to **Prism Element** through **Prism Central**.

For more information on connecting to the cluster; see the « [Go further](#gofurther) » section of this guide. 

On the dashboard, the 3 nodes are visible in the `Hardware Summary`. Click on `View Details`{.action} in the middle left to bring up more details.
