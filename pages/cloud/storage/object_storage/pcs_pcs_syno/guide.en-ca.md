## Objective
[Synology DiskStation Manager 6.0](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/6.0beta){.external} provides a tool for synchronisation with different cloud solutions.

This is compatible with the OVHcloud Public Cloud Object Storage and lets you back up your data and access it from any location. This guide explains how to configure DiskStation Manager 6.0 so that you can synchronise your NAS files and your Object Storage.


## Prerequisites

- [Create an Object Storage container](https://docs.ovh.com/ca/en/storage/object-storage/pcs/create-container/)
- [Configure an Openstack user](https://docs.ovh.com/ca/en/public-cloud/creation-and-deletion-of-openstack-user/#creating-an-openstack-user)


## Instructions

### DiskStation Manager 6.0 configuration
