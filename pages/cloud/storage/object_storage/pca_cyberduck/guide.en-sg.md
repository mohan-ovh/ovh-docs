## Objective

Object Storage is a storage solution that is managed primarily through the OpenStack API. However, you might not be familiar with managing storage space via command line.

There are graphical interface solutions that seamlessly make use of the OpenStack APIs. Cyberduck is a Swift client.

Other interfaces can be found on the Internet and configuration is similar to the configuration explained in this guide.

**This guide will explain how to configure Cyberduck to manage your Object Storage using a GUI based on Openstack APIs.**

## Requirements

- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) installed on your computer.
- your username (*OS_USERNAME*) and project credentials (*OS_PROJECT_NAME* or *OS_TENANT_NAME*). Retrieve them by downloading the OpenRC file from the [Users and Roles](https://docs.ovh.com/sg/en/public-cloud/set-openstack-environment-variables/#step-1-retrieve-the-variables) menu in the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/sg/&ovhSubsidiary=sg).
- your OpenStack user password.

In case you have forgotten your OpenStack user password, you can change it by following [this guide](https://docs.ovh.com/sg/en/public-cloud/change-openstack-user-password/).
