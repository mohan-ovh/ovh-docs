## Objective

The OVHcloud HA-NAS service allows you to manage file storage that can be accessed over a network.

**This guide explains how to manage the ACL of a HA-NAS partition via the OVHcloud API.**

## Requirements

- An OVHcloud [HA-NAS service](https://www.ovh.com/world/nas/)
- Consulting the [OVHcloud API first steps guide](https://docs.ovh.com/us/en/api/first-steps-with-ovh-api/) to familiarise yourself with the OVHcloud APIv6

## Instructions

All API routes in this guide are available in the section */dedicated/nasha*: <<https://ca.api.ovh.com/console/#/dedicated/nasha>.

> [!primary]
>
> When using the API, all fields marked with an asterisk (\*) are required.
>

### Retrieving information about your service

All your active services can be retrieved by using the following route:

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /dedicated/nasha
>

> [!warning]
>
> Access is denied by default unless granted via the ACL. Only IP addresses attached to your OVHcloud services can be added.
>

### Retrieving the ACL of a partition

To retrieve the IP addresses that can access the partition, use the following route:

> [!faq]

> Parameters:
>
>> > **serviceName** *
>> >
>> >> The internal name of your HA-NAS service
>> >
>> > **partitionName** *
>> >
>> >> Name of the partition

### Retrieving all eligible IP addresses

You can verify the IP addresses that are eligible for access via the following API calls:

> [!faq]

>> >
>> > **partitionName** *
>> >

### Adding an ACL entry

To create a new ACL entry that will allow you to connect to your partition, use the following route:

> [!faq]
