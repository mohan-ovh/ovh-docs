## Objective

This guide details how to transfer data from one HA-NAS to another. 

## Requirements

- An OVHcloud HA-NAS
- An NFS-compatible distribution
- You need to have mounted your HA-NAS beforehand by following the guide to [mount your HA-NAS via an NFS](https://docs.ovh.com/au/en/storage/file-storage/nas/nfs/){.external} share.

## Instructions

Compatibility: Debian 6/7/8 & Ubuntu 12/13/14

To transfer your data, we will use the `rsync` command. There are several ways to transfer your data. It's up to you to use one over another.

The following example moves your data from a Source mount point to a Destination mount point.

```sh
rsync -Pva /mnt/SrcNas /mnt/DstNas
```

|Argument|Description|
|---|---|
|SrcNas|Source mount point|
|DstNas|Destination mount point|

> [!alert]
>
> Warning: if you add other options to `rsync`, these may not be compatible with the rights and permissions system of HA-NAS.
