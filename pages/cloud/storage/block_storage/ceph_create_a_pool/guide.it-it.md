## Using web interface

First, connect to the [Cloud Disk Array manager](https://www.ovh.com/manager/cloud/index.html){.external}. Under 'Platforms and services' select your Ceph cluster.

On the bottom right, you will find the existing pools. Pool rbd is created by default and can be use without issue.

Enter a poolname, your pool needs at least three characters.

After pool creation you are back to manager, you can see that cluster status has changed because the pool is being created.

## Using API

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/pool
>
serviceName is the fsid of your cluster.

You can check pool creation by listing pools.


> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /dedicated/ceph/{serviceName}/pool
>
For example:


```bash
GET /dedicated/ceph/98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15/pool
[
{
  replicaCount: 3
  serviceName: "98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15"
  name: "rbd"
  minActiveReplicas: 2
  poolType: "REPLICATED"
  backup: false
},
{
  replicaCount: 3
  serviceName: "98d166d8-7c88-47b7-9cb6-63acd5a59c15"
  name: "testpool"
  minActiveReplicas: 2
  poolType: "REPLICATED"
  backup: true
  }
]
```
