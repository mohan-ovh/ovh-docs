## Objective

The monitoring service allows OVHcloud to monitor the status of your machine and automatically trigger the intervention of a technician in the datacenter.

All the servers of our customers and the entire network are monitored 24/7 by OVHcloud technical teams.

OVHcloud intervenes as soon as an alert (non-response to the pings) is triggered in order to minimize the downtime of the servers and the network.

To implement a restrictive firewall, especially on ICMP, and continue to benefit from OVHcloud monitoring, it is necessary to authorize the IPs that you will find below.

## Requirements

- An OVHcloud service on which you have installed a firewall
- Access to the firewall rules

## Instructions

### IP addresses to be authorised

|Reverse|IP|Protocol|
|---|---|---|
|mrtg-rbx-100|37.187.231.251|icmp|

|proxy.ovh.net|213.186.50.98|icmp|
||xxx.xxx.xxx.250 (xxx.xxx.xxx.aaa is the server ip)|icmp|
||xxx.xxx.xxx.251 (xxx.xxx.xxx.aaa is the server ip)|icmp + Port monitored by the monitoring service|

**Communication between the RTM service and your server also requires that you allow inbound and outbound connections on UDP ports 6100 through 6200.**

### Server monitoring

Log in to the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.ie/&ovhSubsidiary=ie){.external} and select the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} tab. Select the server concerned in the `Dedicated servers`{.action} menu.

You can set the monitoring status for a dedicated server from the `General information`{.action} tab (section **Service status**).

Click on the button `Configure`{.action}. In the popup window, you have three options for the monitoring behaviour:

- **Disabled**: This option stops alert messages and interventions by OVHcloud. Choose this if you are executing pertinent administrative actions on the server which prevent an ICMP response.
- **Enabled with proactive intervention**: If the server stops responding, an alert email is sent to you and the server will be checked by a technician.
- **Enabled without proactive intervention**: You will receive an alert message by email in case the server stops responding. To initiate an intervention, you will need to create a support request.

Click on `Confirm`{.action} to update your monitoring configuration.

### Enabling monitoring for specific services

In addition to standard monitoring, you can authorise OVHcloud to monitor specific services such as HTTP, SSH and other protocols.

In the `General information`{.action} tab, click the `...`{.action} button next to "Monitored services" in the **Service status** box. Click `Monitor my services`{.action}.

You will be redirected to the page below. Click `Monitor a service`{.action}, then enter the IP address, protocol, port number, server response, and time interval between your service checks. Click the validation symbol (**V**) to confirm the changes.
