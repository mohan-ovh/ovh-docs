## Objective

Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID) is a utility that mitigates data loss on a server by replicating data across two or more disks.

The default RAID level for OVHcloud server installations is RAID 1, which doubles the space taken up by your data, effectively halving the usable disk space.

**This guide will help you to configure your server’s disks with RAID 0, which will allow you to use all your disks' usable space.**

> [!warning]
> 
> Please note: RAID 0 provides **NO FAULT TOLERANCE** and **NO DATA REDUNDANCY**, making data loss in the event of disk failure highly likely.
> 

## Requirements

- a [dedicated server](https://www.ovh.com/world/dedicated_servers/){.external} with hardware RAID
- administrative (root) access to the server via SSH

## Instructions

### Using the OVHcloud Control Panel

In the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, click on the `Dedicated`{.action} menu and select your server.

Next, on the `General Information`{.action} tab, click the `Reinstall`{.action} button to install a new operating system with your custom RAID 0 configuration.

Now select **Install from an OVHcloud template** and then click `Next`{.action}.

Select the operating system you want to install and then click `Next`{.action}.

Tick the boxes for **Customise the RAID hardware configuration** and **Customise the partition configuration**, then click `Next`{.action}.

Finally, click `Confirm`{.action}.

After your server has been installed, check the partition sizes by logging on to the server via SSH and running the following command:

```sh
df -h
```

### Using rescue mode

In the [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}, click on the `Dedicated`{.action} menu and select your server.

On the `General Information`{.action} tab, click the `Modify`{.action} button to change the boot system.

Next, select `Boot on rescue mode`{.action} then select `rescue64-pro`{.action} from the drop-down list.

Now, type your email address in the `Get your updated username`{.action} field.

Click `Next`{.action} and then click `Confirm`{.action} on the following screen.

Click the `Restart`{.action} button in the [Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}.

When your server reboots, log in to it via SSH using the rescue mode credentials that were emailed to you.

From the command line, type the following commands to delete the existing RAID settings. All data in the RAID will be deleted:

```sh
MegaCli -CfgLdDel -L0 -a0
MegaCli -CfgLdDel -Lall -aAll
```

Type the following command to retrieve the slot device IDs of your disks:

```sh
MegaCli -PdList -aALL | egrep "Slot|Device ID"
```

Type the following commands to configure RAID level 0:

```sh
MegaCli -CfgLDAdd -R0[252:0,252:1] -a0
```

In this example, 252 is the ID of the drive enclosure.

After setting the new RAID level you can check the settings with the following command:

```sh
MegaCli -LDInfo -Lall -a0 |grep -i size
```
