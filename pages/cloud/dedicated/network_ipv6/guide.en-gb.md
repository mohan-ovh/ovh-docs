**Last updated 26th August 2022**

## Objective

Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP). It is designed to address the long-anticipated address exhaustion of its predecessor, IPv4, by using 128-bit addresses instead of 32-bit addresses. Every OVHcloud dedicated server comes with a /64 IPv6 block. This represents over 18 quintillion IP addresses that you can use at your convenience.

**This guide explains how to configure IPv6 addresses on your server using various examples.**

> [!warning]
>OVHcloud is providing you with services for which you are responsible, with regard to their configuration and management. You are therefore responsible for ensuring they function correctly.
>
>This guide is designed to assist you in common tasks as much as possible. Nevertheless, we recommend that you contact a [specialist service provider](https://partner.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/directory/) and/or discuss the issue with [our community](https://community.ovh.com/en/) if you face difficulties or doubts concerning the administration, usage or implementation of services on a server.
>

## Requirements

- A [dedicated server](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en-gb/bare-metal/) in your OVHcloud account
- All your IPv6 information (prefix, gateway etc.)
- Basic knowledge of [SSH](/pages/cloud/dedicated/ssh_introduction) and networking

> [!warning]
> Please note that Kimsufi servers are only provided with a single IPV6 block (/128). IPv6 will be configured automatically when installing the OS.
>

## Instructions

If you are using an OVHcloud-provided Linux OS template to install your server, you will need to configure the first (main) IPv6 on the server.

For example, if we have assigned to your server the IPv6 range: `2607:5300:xxxx:xxxx::/64` you may use as main IPv6 of your server the IPv6: `2607:5300:xxxx:xxxx::1/64`.

If you want to have more than one IPv6 configured on your server (or want to use it on a VM) you will need to have an Additional IP configured with a vMAC. Otherwise, the IPv6 cannot be routed by our routers/switches.

> [!primary]
>
> The default gateway for your IPv6 block (IPv6_GATEWAY) is usually xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxFF:FF:FF:FF:FF. Please note that the leading "0's" can be removed in an IPv6 to avoid errors when determining the gateway.  
>
> For example:
> 
> - The IPv6 range of the server is `2607:5300:60:62ac::/64` or `2607:5300:60:62ac:0000:0000:0000:0000/64`. The IPv6_GATEWAY will therefore be `2607:5300:60:62FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`.
> - The IPv6 range of the server is `2001:41D0:1:46e::/64` or `2001:41D0:0001:046e:0000:0000:0000:0000/64`. The IPv6_GATEWAY will therefore be `2001:41D0:1:4FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`.
>
> The safe way to retrieve the networking information for your server is to [use the OVHcloud API](/pages/account/api/first-steps). Execute the following API call, indicating the internal server name (example: `ns3956771.ip-169-254-10.eu`):
>


> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/specifications/network
>

> [!warning]
>
> Before modifying a configuration file, always create a backup of the original.

### Debian and Debian-based operating systems

> [!warning]
>
> Before following the steps below, we strongly suggest that you disable IPv6 autoconf and router advertising to prevent known issues. You can do so by adding the following lines to your `sysctl.conf` file, which is located in /etc/sysctl.conf:
> 
> `net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf=0`
> 
> `net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra=0`
> 
> Once this has been done, you can apply those rules by executing the following command: `sh sysctl -p`.
> 

#### Step 1: Use SSH to connect to your server

Find more information in [this guide](/pages/cloud/dedicated/getting-started-with-dedicated-server#logging-on-to-your-server).

#### Step 2: Open your server's network configuration file

Your server's network configuration file is either located in `/etc/network/interfaces` or `/etc/network/interfaces.d`. Use the command line to locate the file and open it for editing. Also consider creating a backup first.

#### Step 3: Amend the network configuration file

Amend the file so that it looks like the example below. In this example, the network interface is called `eth0`. The interface on your server may differ.

```console
iface eth0 inet6 static 
    address YOUR_IPv6 
    netmask 128

post-up /sbin/ip -f inet6 route add IPv6_GATEWAY dev eth0 
post-up /sbin/ip -f inet6 route add default via IPv6_GATEWAY 
pre-down /sbin/ip -f inet6 route del IPv6_GATEWAY dev eth0
pre-down /sbin/ip -f inet6 route del default via IPv6_GATEWAY
```

Additional IPv6 addresses can be added by `up /sbin/ifconfig eth0 inet6 add YOUR_2nd_IPv6/64` lines in the file.

#### Step 4: Save the file and apply the changes

Save your changes to the file and then restart the network or reboot your server to apply the changes.

#### Step 5: Test the IPv6 connectivity

You can test the IPv6 connectivity by running the commands shown below:

```bash
ping6 -c 4 2001:4860:4860::8888

>>> PING 2001:4860:4860::8888(2001:4860:4860::8888) 56 data bytes
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=23.6 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=23.8 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=23.9 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=23.8 ms

>>> --- 2001:4860:4860::8888 ping statistics ---
>>> 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
>>> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 23.670/23.670/23.670/0.000 ms
```


If you are not able to ping this IPv6 address, check your configuration and try again. Also ensure that the machine you are testing from is connected with IPv6. If it still does not work, please test your configuration in [Rescue mode](/pages/cloud/dedicated/rescue_mode).

### Fedora 26 and above

> [!warning]
>
> This example has been made with CentOS 7.0. Results may vary when using other Redhat derivatives.
>

#### Step 1: Use SSH to connect to your server

Find more information in [this guide](/pages/cloud/dedicated/getting-started-with-dedicated-server#logging-on-to-your-server).


#### Step 2: Open your server's network configuration file

Your server's network configuration file is located in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`. Use the command line to locate this file and open it for editing.

#### Step 3: Amend the network configuration file

Amend the file so that it looks like the example below. In this example, the network interface is called eth0. The interface on your server may differ. Also, we have omitted the IPv4 configuration to avoid confusion, but the IPv6 configuration is made in the same configuration file.

```console
IPV6INIT=yes
IPV6_AUTOCONF=no
IPV6_DEFROUTE=yes
IPV6_FAILURE_FATAL=no
IPV6ADDR=YOUR_IPv6/64
IPV6ADDR_SECONDARIES=YOUR_2nd_IPv6/64 YOUR_3rd_IPv6/64
IPV6_DEFAULTGW=IPv6_GATEWAY
```
If you need more IPv6 addresses on the machine, add them in the `IPV6ADDR_SECONDARIES` line, separated by whitespace.

#### Step 4: Save the file and apply the changes

Save your changes to the file and then restart the network or reboot your server to apply the changes.

#### Step 5: Test the IPv6 connectivity

You can test the IPv6 connectivity by running the commands shown below:

```bash
ping6 -c 4 2001:4860:4860::8888

>>> PING 2001:4860:4860::8888(2001:4860:4860::8888) 56 data bytes
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=23.6 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=23.8 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=23.9 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=23.8 ms

>>> --- 2001:4860:4860::8888 ping statistics ---
>>> 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
>>> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 23.670/23.670/23.670/0.000 ms
```

If you are not able to ping this IPv6 address, check your configuration and try again. Also ensure that the machine you are testing from is connected with IPv6. If it still does not work, please test your configuration in [Rescue mode](/pages/cloud/dedicated/rescue_mode).

### FreeBSD

#### Step 1: Use SSH to connect to your server

Find more information in [this guide](/pages/cloud/dedicated/getting-started-with-dedicated-server#logging-on-to-your-server).


#### Step 2: Open your server's network configuration file

Your server's network configuration file is located in `/etc/rc.conf`. Use the command line to locate this file and open it for editing.

#### Step 3: Amend the network configuration file

Amend the file so that it looks like the example below. In this example, the network interface is called em0. The interface on your server may differ.

```bash
IPv6_activate_all_interfaces="YES" 
IPv6_defaultrouter="IPv6_GATEWAY" 
ifconfig_em0_IPv6="inet6 IPv6_Address prefixlen 64"
ifconfig_em0_alias0="inet6 IPv6_Address_2 prefixlen 64"
ifconfig_em0_alias1="inet6 IPv6_Address_3 prefixlen 64"
```

#### Step 4: Save the file and reboot the server

Save your changes to the file and then restart the network or reboot your server to apply the changes.

#### Step 5: Test the IPv6 connectivity

You can test the IPv6 connectivity by running the commands shown below:

```bash
ping6 -c 4 2001:4860:4860::8888

>>> PING 2001:4860:4860::8888(2001:4860:4860::8888) 56 data bytes
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=23.6 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=23.8 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=23.9 ms
>>> 64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=4 ttl=55 time=23.8 ms

>>> --- 2001:4860:4860::8888 ping statistics ---
>>> 1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
>>> rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 23.670/23.670/23.670/0.000 ms
```

If you are not able to ping this IPv6 address, check your configuration and try again. Also ensure that the machine you are testing from is connected with IPv6. If it still does not work, please test your configuration in [Rescue mode](/pages/cloud/dedicated/rescue_mode).

### Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04

#### Step 1: Use SSH to connect to your server

Find more information in [this guide](/pages/cloud/dedicated/getting-started-with-dedicated-server#logging-on-to-your-server).

#### Step 2: Open your server's network configuration file

Open the network configuration file located in `/etc/netplan`. For demonstration purposes, our file is called '50-cloud-init.yaml'.

#### Step 3: Amend the network configuration file

Using a text editor, amend the '50-cloud-init.yaml' file by adding the following lines to the relevant sections as shown in the example below.

Replace the generic elements (i.e. YOUR_IPV6, IPV6_PREFIX and IPV6_GATEWAY) as well as the network interface (if your server is not using enp1s0) with your specific values. 

```yaml
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        enp1s0:
            dhcp4: true
            match:
                macaddress: 00:04:0p:8b:c6:30
            set-name: enp1s0
            addresses:
              - YOUR_IPV6/IPv6_PREFIX
            gateway6: IPv6_GATEWAY
            routes:
                - to: IPv6_GATEWAY
                  scope: link
```

### Ubuntu 21.10 and 22.04

The configuration file should look like the example below:

```yaml
network:
    version: 2
    ethernets:
        enp1s0:
            dhcp4: true
            match:
                macaddress: 00:04:0p:8b:c6:30
            set-name: enp1s0
            addresses:
              - YOUR_IPV6/IPv6_PREFIX
            routes:
                - to: ::/0
                  via: IPv6_GATEWAY
                - to: IPv6_GATEWAY
                  scope: link
```


> [!warning]
> It is important to respect the alignment of each element in this file as represented in the example above. Do not use the tab key to create your spacing. Only the space key is needed.
>

#### Step 4: Test and apply the configuration

You can test your configuration using this command:

```bash
netplan try
```

If it is correct, apply it using the following command:

```bash
netplan apply
```

#### Step 5: Test the IPv6 connectivity

You can test the IPv6 connectivity by running the commands shown below:

```bash
ping6 -c 4 2001:4860:4860::8888

PING 2001:4860:4860::8888(2001:4860:4860::8888) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=1 ttl=57 time=4.07 ms
64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=2 ttl=57 time=4.08 ms
64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=3 ttl=57 time=4.08 ms
64 bytes from 2001:4860:4860::8888: icmp_seq=4 ttl=57 time=4.07 ms
