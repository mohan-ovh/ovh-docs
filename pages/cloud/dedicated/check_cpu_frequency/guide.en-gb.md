## Requirements
The MC-64 OC range (2018) has an i7-7700k processor that has its base frequency at 4.2 Ghz, or 4.5 Ghz in turbo.

We have tested this processor in order to increase performance and we have developed an overclock profile of this processor to 4.7 Ghz in use on several cores, or 5 Ghz in turbo mode using only one core.

To perform the steps in this guide, you must :

- Have a MC-64 OC server.
- Have SSH access.
- Have Remote Desktop access (For Windows).


## Procedure

### Check the frequency from rescue mode
You can connect to your server in SSH with the rescue password that you received by email.

In rescue mode, we can see the frequency in real time with this command :

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@rescue:~# watch -n 0 "lscpu | grep MHz"</span>
<span class="output">Every 0.1s: lscpu | grep MHz                                                  Sat Jan  7 20:36:21 2017</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="output">CPU MHz:               800.312</span>
<span class="output">CPU max MHz:           4700.0000</span>
<span class="output">CPU min MHz:           800.0000</span> </pre></div>
At rest, the processor reduces the frequency to reduce power consumption.

When we issue a `burnP6`{.action} on a single thread, it uses only one core and therefore we have the maximum CPU frequency.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@rescue:~# burnP6</span>
<span class="prompt">root@rescue:~# lscpu | grep MHz</span>
<span class="output">CPU MHz:               4671.562</span>
<span class="output">CPU max MHz:           4700.0000</span>
<span class="output">CPU min MHz:           800.0000</span> </pre></div>
The more threads we use, the lower the maximum frequency will be.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@rescue:~# burnP6 & burnP6 & burnP6 & burnP6</span>
<span class="output">[1] 19146</span>
<span class="output">[2] 19147</span>
<span class="output">[3] 19148</span>
<span class="blank">&nbsp;</span>
<span class="prompt">root@rescue:~# lscpu | grep MHz</span>
<span class="output">CPU MHz:               4400.625</span>
<span class="output">CPU max MHz:           4700.0000</span>
<span class="output">CPU min MHz:           800.0000</span> </pre></div>

### Check the frequency with a linux OS
Sometimes the distribution is too old and the lscpu command is not available.

In this case we have an alternative that is `i7z`{.action}.

You can install and run it as follows (This also works in rescue mode).

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="prompt">root@ns3054631:~# wget ftp://ftp.ovh.net/made-in-ovh/dedie/bench/i7z_64bit</span>

<span class="prompt">root@ns3054631:~# ./i7z_64bit</span> </pre></div>
You will then have a output that looks like this.

<div> <style type="text/css" scoped>span.prompt:before{content:"# ";}</style> <pre class="highlight command-prompt"> <span class="output">Cpu speed from cpuinfo 4007.00Mhz</span>

It should be noted, however, that the frequencies shown on the **CPU speed from cpuinfo** line and the **True Frequency** line are not the actual frequencies of the processor. The only values that count are those shown on **Core**.


### Check the frequency with Windows OS and WinPE mode
You can also check the frequency of the server in WinPE mode.

To do this, you must install a 3rd party piece of software because Windows can not read the actual native processor speeds.

Go to the [official CPU-Z website](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html){.external} to download this software, and install it.

We will then have a window showing the real frequencies of the processor :



> [!primary]

> To display the clocks window, go to Tools **, then click **clocks.
>

![freq_win2](images/guide_freq_win2.png){.thumbnail}

You will notice that the speed limits to 5 Ghz when using a single core.

For the rest of the test in Windows, we used the [CPU stress MT](https://www.octeam.fr/remository/utilitaires-cpu/cpu-stress-mt.html){.external}.

Once installed, to launch a bench, just click on the button `Start`{.action} without modifying the configurations.

If we run a bench of the processor, we will then have the speed of 4.7 Ghz.
