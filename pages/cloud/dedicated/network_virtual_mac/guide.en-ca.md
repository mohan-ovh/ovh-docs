## Objective

OVHcloud allows you to associate a virtual MAC address with an IP address, so that you can set up virtual machines with a bridge configuration on your server.

**This guide will show you how to create a virtual MAC address and assign it to a failover IP address.**

## Requirements

* a [Dedicated Server](https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/){.external}
* a [failover IP address](https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/dedicated-servers/ip_failover.xml){.external} or a failover IP block (RIPE)
* access to your [OVHcloud Control Panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca){.external}


## Instructions

### Assign a MAC address

To assign a virtual MAC address to a failover IP, you first need to connect to your OVHcloud Control panel.

Once connected, click the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} menu and then click the `IP`{.action} section on the left side of the page.

Once you're in the IP section, locate your failover IP address (or block) in the list and then click the `...`{.action} button to bring up the list of options.

> **Type:** Refers to the virtual MAC address type ('VmWare' will be a MAC address made for the VmWare ESXi system, while 'OVHcloud' will be for any other type of virtualisation system).
>
> **Name of virtual machine:** Refers to the desired name for the virtual MAC address, in order to make it easy to identify this IP/MAC pair in the future.

### Delete a MAC address

> [!warning]

> When a MAC address is deleted, it will not be recoverable.

To remove a virtual MAC address associated with a failover IP, you must first connect to your [control panel](https://ca.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager&from=https://www.ovh.com/ca/en/&ovhSubsidiary=ca){.external}. Once connected, click on the `Bare Metal Cloud`{.action} menu and then click the `IP`{.action} section on the left side of the page. Select the correct server, so that the failover IP (or IP block) attached to it appears.

Finally, click on the `...`{.action} button on the right, then click `Delete the Virtual MAC`{.action}.
