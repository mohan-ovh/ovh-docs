## How to contribute

### Pull requests and commit form

The contributions should be done using GitHub Pull Requests on **develop** branch only. We use a standard form for all commits : `<Language - Type of change (Add / Update) - Directory name>`.  
For example : FR Update Change email password. Product shortcut can be added if relevant.

### Pull Request Reviews

All pull requests are reviewed by our Technical Copywriters team to ensure that our guide style is respected and that all technical information are correct. Your pull request won't be merged immediately, each request will be reviewed. So changes may apply when merged is done.

Once validated by our reviewers, the request will be merged and made public shortly after. If the online version doesn't suit your original needs, feel free to tell us.

Our team will do their best to answer and deal with your request as fast as possible.
